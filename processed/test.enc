No
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Like you care.
But
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I just wanted --
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
No, but
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You know French?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
He seems like he thrives on danger
You got him involved?
Her favorite uncle
What've you got for me?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Where ya goin?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
William didn't even go to high school
Excuse me?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
I hate him.
Busy
Maybe.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Good call.
Something like that
No one else knows
It wasn't like that.
No, Daddy.
Which parts?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Absolutely not.
I don't want you to wait for me.
They took everything...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says -- how many?
He understands.
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Colon!
I believed in you...
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
What do you read?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Yes, I considered it.
What are you asking me?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
In the kitchen.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Oh.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
When?
Describe him.
I'll come with you.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Two heads.
Of course.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
What's your accomplishment.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
How many victims are up there?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I am butcher.
You stuff sausage in it.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Credit?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Ha. Ha.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I speak English.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
I'll take him.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Your doctor?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Yes.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
CONINUED
I'm having a party tomorrow.
How many days until you come home?
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
That's true.
Roger.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
What's the matter with my place?
Would you guys...
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I don't give out the details.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
We split 50-50?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
You okay?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
So do you...been a long day.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
You sure you want me to?
Jack, are you okay?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hello.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
How about some ammo?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
What are we going to do?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I don't have time... I need to know.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
You little sleaze bag!
6... 5...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I've had enough good news for today
...Shit!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Apipoussan?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I told you not to read all that crap!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
How's our deal coming along?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
What happened to you?
Tom...
I don't know what to say
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
You said something about money.
We can do that.
Where's that?
Leave him alone.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
We do.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
I know what you did.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Yeah.
Something like that.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Keep moving.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Look, you cocksucker...
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Yeah... guess so.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I don't know, where are yours?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Specialty product.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
He's odd.
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
It won't work like that.
You've found missing persons before.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Do you think the police did a good job?
Will you let me look?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
What?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You're his sister, right?
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Then what else can we do?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
What's wrong with me?
What is it?
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hey...wake up.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Where is he?
Hi, beautiful.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
But how are we gonna --
Who's Jacob?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Who?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I guess.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
You hear that?
What about down?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
The frogmen?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
He's on to us!
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Oh.
What happened?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Yes.
How about a Big Mac?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
How you holding up, Wade?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Lillian!
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
For a while.
I'm sorry.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Alright. I'll think about it.
What happened?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
He got his deer yet?
Who?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
What happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
A hunting accident is perfect.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
How was...  ...the ballet?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Can we do that?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Flying the plane.
Where are we sending it?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
You give me ulcers.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What's the story?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
What is it, Mary?
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Who's that, Ted?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted!
I'm so excited, Simon.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Sure.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Don't try to stop me!
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Thank you. Cream?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Both pilots!
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Ted!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted...
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh, I can't stand it.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
We have clearance, Clarence.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Kill them both.
Here?
What is wrong?
Get the picture?
Did you learn anything?
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
What was that about?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
What is this?!
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
The human?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
This floor's freezing.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Can't lock up...
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I'll go.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
Now, wait a second --
One of us?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Fuck you.
Looks like it stung him.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Did you ever have a baby?
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Good morning.
A Turkish brothel.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Don't bother!
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
What is it?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Yes!
Wolfi!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
You're not going to do this?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Tonight?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Just one year.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Really?
Yes, where?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
What is it?
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I have no idea.
Yes, sir.
Am I not welcome?
How is your financial situation?
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Papa!
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Sssh!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Animals?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
I'm sorry. No.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
How fortunate.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Are you neglecting my request?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, please.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
What?
Finish what?
That's wonderful!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Oh? Have I seen it?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
No, you didn't!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Are you absolutely sure?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Who is she?
But he's all right?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Bene.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Warn him?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
Do you like it?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Will you think about it?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Alex?
Anything.
I've left those pills for you.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Don't you remember?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
What?
No.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Are you cold?
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I have no idea.
Pecos Bill.
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I can't stand it.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
David!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Get out of here, Jack!
A monster. I know, I know.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
I could hang myself.
No, thank you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Then you have some hot tea?
No, thank you.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
And tell him not to delay.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
know, but—
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't you know?
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Well . . .
Happy now?
Oh!
Helen!
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
You're lying!
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
He's at a board meeting.
I'm afraid so.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Mr. Williams . . .
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
How are you fixed?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
This is the best score yet.
He's not bad at it.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
You have no shame.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
I could use the walk.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
What is wrong with you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Perfect, Cole.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I got us through the War all right.
I'm out.
Missed you, cousin.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
The safe. Now.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Of St. Louis?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
You're right, sir.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
If I could go back to farming --
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Did you kill Yankees?
Jesse, is that your hand?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
A river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I beg your pardon?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Mmm.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Was it worth it?
Thank you.
I like that.
I guess so.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Just perfect.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
How much did they get from the safe?
Parker.
How did you know?
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
I'm ignoring you.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
We should do it.
He's good-looking.
He has a great body
We never really shared one.
Where are you going?
Can I help you?
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Yes, naturally.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
We are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Yes?
Who?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
...to the office this afternoon.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Well...
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
What?
No. I really don't.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Yeah.
Don't tell him you're here.
KIMBALL.
Nice. Very nice.
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Don't you know this?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
I mean they want to get caught.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Not in the mood, I guess.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo. Why would he --
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
This is good. Who did it?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
It's three years old, it --
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Jesus, Teddy.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Did you tell Alice?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
I could get it out of him.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
When do I begin?
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Hello, Exposition.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Why not? It's a question.
What's wrong with your hand?
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I'm sorry.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Are you crazy?
I have something to tell you.
I love you, Austin.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
Shut up.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Ow! You shot me!
My son?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
An evil petting zoo?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I'm proud of you.
We don't label people here, Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... love ...
Have we met?
May I help you, madam ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then who wins?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
To find out who killed my husband.
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Frankly that's how I remember it.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Is there anything that isn't?
Three agents killed by bad weather...
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
You don't believe him?
Decontamination -- ?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Privately owned by ...
Oh, hello ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Guilty until proven innocent?
No, please! I beg you ...
I was at Harrow ...
Rules are made to be broken.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
You're kidding.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
And...
I want Debbie.
Cole...
Seventy-five hundred.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I love that car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
What's the matter?
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
Yeah.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Great bathing suit.
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
It's true.
Yes.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I don't know.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
My Debbie?
You're late again, Rick.
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
This?
Ready?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Jennifer.
I work for city hall.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
I was doing my job.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
-- Shhh.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
What reason?
What the hell are you doing here?
Then who wrote the report?
No.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
I have a job.
Do you have to do that?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
I'm busy.
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Didn't think you'd make it.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
You don't know... nobody knows...
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
How are you doing, man?
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
This psycho can.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
What case?
Yes, Sister?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Yeah!
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Yeah, him.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What do I do?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
How did you know?
Do you know how you will use him?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
We both lied to him.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Yes, your name?
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You sound like the media.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Yes he did.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Where are you from?
Finland.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Oh her.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...yes she did.
...too late, maybe around...
I don't know who I am.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Why don't you call him?
You leave something out?
And what?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
I know I won't be your puppet.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
What is the service, sir?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
I don't know.
Yes, sir.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
No.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Yes!
Was he cheated?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
What do we do?
Did -- did you --
West was one thing, but this --
I just don't like it.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
Do what?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Back up.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
He admitted it.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Something funny, Levi?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Home, I'm done.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
You knew Sergeant West?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
He's in interrogation?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
What is that?
I plan to grow on you.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
You couldn't have known --
So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
No.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
Wait --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
The fuck are you talking about --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Yeah.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
What do you think?
What happens to Dunbar now?
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
What is this place?
You won't find a better place!
You get the eye?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
How old are you?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You must be Edward Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Please. Go. Just go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
I like your stories.
Karl.
Okay.
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
You think I'm fake.
Tell me how it happens.
You don't even know me.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
You didn't become crazy.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Yes.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yeah it was okay.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
What?
Right.
Tell me what he said.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants the money from your bank.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Is that everything?
Yes.
Yes.
Today is bath day.
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Excuse me?
No.
Sometimes which?
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
What does it mean?
Just wanted to see.
You hurt it?
Angela?
Is your niece older than 12?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Can I put it in your mouth?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
I keep the heat on.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Why you got me chained?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
You take it straight?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Sorry.
What'chu sayin'?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Rae...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
You feelin' sick?
What?
I feel better. Do you?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
You got any money?
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
What's this?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Hey, when in Rome --
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Getting very weird.
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Are you expecting anyone?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
What'd I tell you?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
I'm not drunk...
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Don't be an ass.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I want a gun.
You had my help, detective.
He knows what he's doing.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
One man.  He must be good.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Why are you staring at us?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
When do you deliver your project?
When?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
You start.
What about a summary then.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I like you.
How old am I?
You're going to be over the limit.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Taffey Lewis?
What night?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It's artificial?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
I've already got more help than I need.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
You use your equipment, don't you?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
What do you want me to do?
You did?
Where is he?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You mean a woman?
Ten years.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
May I ask a personal question?
How do you know I'm not?
I'm tired of this.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What desert?
Pris.
Where are your folks?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Whatcha doin'?
You're kidding!
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
It was amazing.
Nope.
It's Perry!
Watching television in color.
See, ya.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Yes.
Because I want to get married.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
It does?
Everybody's divorced.
Stop that ma'am crap!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Yes!
May I please be excused?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
I certainly do!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Not that one!
What have you ordered?
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I'm leaving, too.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Hi, Eve!
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Your mom made that all by herself.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
...the pipe tobacco.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
That's what everybody believes?
And it's called...?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Why not? He has great pants.
Good-bye, Adam.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
The sky?  Where?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Dad!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
This is your bedroom?
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
It's time.
No.  They all do.
Days??
I'm not hungry.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Where did he get all that information?
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
What?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Come into the study a minute.
It must be great.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
No. Come on.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Do you like the way I feel?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Hi, can I come in?
Look.
No.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
What do you want?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Here's to Ben.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Do you want the car?
Good to see you, son.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Terrible boring.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
What happened to him?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
That sounds good.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
What am I going to do?
Everything okay?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You look beautiful.
NO.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
No Jeffrey!!
What did he bring him in for?
Fuck you.
I need Il Duce.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
I can't find the second one, sir.
What?
You think they sold me out? No way.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What happened?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
They got nothing.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
We're alive.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Fuck!
me up the...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
I'm serious.
A bit.
That was way easier than I thought.
Aye.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
How do you figure?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
My, my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The fat man.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
What the...?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You believe?
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
The... The funny man.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
She's really kind of hot.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Well, then cut it in half.
What about them?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Hi.
What. What's the matter?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Which one was that?
We said 48 hours.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
What?
Shh.
I think we better go home.
She needed it.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Help me move him.
You're kidding.
What?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Yes, he did.
Death.
We're renegades from despair.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
How long are they going to hold him?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
No, I don't mind.
Was Future Man adopted?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Cuba.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Wait. Did he see us?
That never would of --
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
It's registered in my mother's name.
Bob. Are you coming?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
You said 48 hours!
Bob, you're lying!
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
The elevator broke.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Why did he go that way? 
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
That's not gonna fly.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
You called it in?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I love you, too.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
What is this, a game?
A Russian?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Me? Four years.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
So let the council swear publicly.
He was a modest man.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
I'll wait... back there.
Rest, William.
Good to see you again.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
It matters not, he is thy king!
I do not confess.
You've been here before?
Nor I!
I'm dreaming.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
I am trying.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Straight up.
Weirder than this?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
But I... I need those books.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
So how's Tommy?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Of course.
Where... where are my clothes?
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
I just thought you should know.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
What time is it?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
And you are...?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Look what you made me do!
How long have you been married?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
-- Tonight he forgot.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Yes, something.
Do you know where they are?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
And the other alternative?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Yes, of course, we --
Please.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Hello, Sam.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You are very kind.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Ask me?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
But we made a deal.
My bill.
May we proceed with the business?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Ho, diplomatist!
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Oh, how do you do?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Huh?
You're late.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
You think of everything, don't you?
Make it official, if you like.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
I would advise you not to interfere.
No.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
What's that you're playing?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Nobody remembers that.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
No.  that was the last one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Merry Christmas eve.
You know, for when you travel.
This isn't working out.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I know.
Yeah?
Come on.  Try.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Really?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
I was making a point.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
For the third time.
I braided them.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
What's the *medical* explanation?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
*What* will be okay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
*Liver* killed him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
At what altitude?
Migrants?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
In other words, scurvy.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Where's the name sheet?
I thought it was my turn.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
That's *it*?
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
They told me I was too old to serve.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
I told you, use less powder.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Calls?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
No.  What's my cut?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
He was looking out for you.
You got my cell. Leave a message.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
King ain't gonna like this.
Of what? They're both crooks.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Eee Oott Auught!
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What do you get out of it?
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I despise the job.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
She went back to South Africa.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I found her in bed with someone.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Are you drunk?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Never. Why do you ask?
How did you know I was here?
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
I want to buy a car.
No.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Yes, I know that.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
There's a casino in this hotel.
Near the casino.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I owe a lot of money.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Next time it'll be my neck.
Let it go.
Yes.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
And your hand too.
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
We do. 
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Very impressive.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Oh, God...
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's it.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Out where?
I need a diameter approximation.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What's that, sir?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
What're you looking for?
I'll make it worth your while.
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
Can you help me get her back?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
First time I ever heard that.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Something.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
I won't be staying.
Bent.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
A girl.
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Thank you.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
No.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
Gotta go.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Playing hooky again?
Right, the big one-oh.
Max--
Does this person have a name?
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
What happens if you level with her?
She tells you how I've been--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
True, but--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I-I c-can't...
We've got to take this slow...
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Namely?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
I got...
Ahh, sunshine.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
But, mom!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
I don't even think you have a gun!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Why do they call you Frank?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
You mean soap?
Yeah?
And what?
That's alright... I understand.
Are you okay?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
My mom is gone.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
His name is Frank.
What else do you think about during school?
Who is the boss?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
Is Callie still around?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Because I'm so horny.
Where is he, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Yeah.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
Yep.
Rose.
Chut up!
What is this shit?
Where is she?!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Yah?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Hi.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
My dress'll reek.
Ohio...
Becky was my only shot at state!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Here I am, Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't wanna work at all.
My card.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
You no gotta no gun.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's even a greater honor.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
Yes.
Your Excellency!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
So that's the one you want to marry.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Hmmm?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Don't!
Good morning, Treves.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Alas, no.
Is he... dying then?
Want to come out?
Thank you very much.
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
...Yyes
Hello...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Good morning, John.
Yes.
My home.
Oh no, I couldn't.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What was she like?
You're as bad as my father.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
How do we know this is the way?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
Would you like us to sing to you?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
But you don't want to hear it.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
REALLY?
No. 
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
What about the raping?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Scream.
Ah.
How deep IS the ocean?
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
I met this girl...
What "magic"?
You must help us.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
Who gets killed?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
I know. I know.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Let me go, Sven.
Get away, Snorri.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Relax!
You've lost your mind.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
So did your father...
I must only let the red rage...
Well, of course he is!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Well I'M certainly not, either.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Thanks, guys.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Come over after I'm done here?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Really? Because --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Huckleberry Hound?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Okay.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Yeah.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.
No.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joely...
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
You know what I did.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Um, no.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
So go.
Make love?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I guess so.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
She's so sexy.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Yeah. Cool.
We haven't checked.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Well, what should we do?
What do you want, Stan?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
That's lovely.
I have a family, Mary.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
You can if you want.
What's your bartlett's?
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I don't.
Tell me about it.
About...
What is Debbie's position?
Extraordinary!
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
What are you doing?
I have to go, Julian.
A born freak can only go uphill.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
I don't know anything about it.
Is that an offer?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Peters is right, no one's here.
I found one.
...you okay?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Any survivors?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
What about my ship?
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
Jesus...
We've got some weather.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain, we got a problem.
Where is it, where is it...
Miller...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
We have to do something, oh God...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Explosive decompression.
How?
The forward airlock.
What did you wish for, honey?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
What the --!
What is that thing?
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You want to work at Carl's?
Of course.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I can't find it, mon!
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Why?
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
You're a really good kisser.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's definitely your mama.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Well, I've gotta be running.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
My brother's car!
How's it going.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What do you think?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
He's not coming.
What class?
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks for picking me up.
That's a nice shirt.
I think I better take you home.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
Thanks for coming to get me.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
What happened? What did they do to her?
He wanted the pineal gland.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Not much. Why?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
The cops?
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Yes!
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
And that's how I ended up here.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
I'm in.
You wanna see, baby?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Move slow and move quiet.
Shit!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's go!
Get to your cars!
We all have to be strong, right?
Oh...
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Um, well...
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Oh. I mean, good.
Thank you --
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You're afraid!
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
...Yes.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
What do I do, Dad?
And you think it's worth all this?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
They'll mend.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Frances...
Oh no...
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Frances...
What's left of my blood.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
There's just one more thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Shit!
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
I don't care.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Excuse me.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...
...Did you really say that?
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Frances, I'm warning you...
Symington says...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
So have I
Are you all right?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Your decision. For us.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Victor!
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
No. They don't.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Electricity.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You draw very well.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
You know what I said, though.
Give me a hand?
Chance to get even?
I don't believe you...
I don't love Neddy.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Good luck.
You like the car?
So let's do it.
What are you gonna do?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Sorry, I need everybody.
My wife.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Who else?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
What's this stuff?
I promise.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
Not many.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- you got your sink --
Not even for lunch?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
They're gonna search the van.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Where are you?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Then good night.
Entering my scan now...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Yes?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
O'Neil?
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Which is guy-speak for...
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That bad?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
I'd sure like to know who.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
32 feet, six inches!
Say again, sir?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
O'Neil...
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
You never said it was off the record.
Circuits are overloaded.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
I'm sorry about all this.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
That's right.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Are you looking for this?
It's the French Secret Service.
Why do you need that?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
We've got to stop!
About this much.
Go ahead!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
Not again...
Settle down, Alex...
Why didn't you stop at the market?
What?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Yes Commander?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Up.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
U.... What do you think?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
No, I'll kill you. .
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
How do you remember this stuff?
It's suicide.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
...Okay
They're still behind us...
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
~e're alive!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
What?  What did he say?
You know, that's really getting annoying.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Wait. What did you say?
We.. We lie.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
An interstellar vox.
NO, Thank God he has not.
Well... Sort of...
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
How about the pig-lizard?
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Misunderstood what!?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
That's right...
What else?  From Virginia?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Where... do those men come from, George?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I guess still in the locker.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
I have to ask you for that key.
Your who?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
What's this movie you're doing first?
You can talk to me.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
I need the money.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I don't know.
What three hundred grand?
Hello? You there?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
How'd you get in here?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What does that mean?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
What do you get out of this?
Yeah, he told me.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Very nice...
Compass.
They report it to the IRS.
I'm up twelve grand today.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I told you not to -–
Hello, Doris.
I miss Murray, Harry.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Oh, for Christ's sake –-
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
That's what it says.
You think that's funny
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
The right way and the wrong way.
Goddamit, Dodge.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Yeah.
You're late.
That's what I call a payday.
Coffee.
Candy?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Did you see him?
There's somebody else on this boat.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Murphy to Epps.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
That much I think we've already established.
What?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Of course they did.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Say what?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
A what?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Are you still looking for a job?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
...wow...
Huh?
Aren't there a million places like this?
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Oh, hi...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
God, what a bunch of retards...
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
I might actually get the pasta special.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Where are we going?
Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
So should I come over?
Nothing.
When was this?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Hi... what's your name?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Do you have any old Indian records?
A dollar seventy-five.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
Yeah, well...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
For nineteen years...
Are you okay?
Uh... hello?
So, what happened?
Boo!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
Well when can we do something?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, of course not.
In what way do you mean?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What are you doing here?
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
What do you want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
They're Seymour's.
Yeah.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Then why do you stay?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Anything special about them?
Shhh.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
Think about something else.
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Soon. 
You've known him long?
Why so many?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Everybody has a choice.
Occasionally
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
His name is Oscar.
I'll do it.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Good luck.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Does she know anything about babies?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Can I help you?
What are you doing up here?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I await the word of Vigo.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Egon!
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
And now you're going to eat it?
What kind of tests?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
What's your story, Pete?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Now where are you going?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I told you, I ...
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Don't scream.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Really!  Is it gone?
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
That is one speedy mutt.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
All right.  I'll try.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Who?
Set entry grid.
What do I say?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Where are you, Pete?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Me, too.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Not yet, dear brother...
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Gladly Caesar.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Take grain away from the army?
Yes, Caesar?
Yes, Caesar.
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The Senate too?
You're hearing about somebody else.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
He killed his father and then my family...
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
So I understand.
The Senators admire you.
Tomorrow?
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What the hell was all that about?
My troops don't make policy.
Greeks?
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
You teach them!
Who the hell are you?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Do you want some dinner?
No.
I want to go home.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Benjamin --
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
You sure you really want to?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What is it?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
GET OUT!
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
What?
All right then! Yes!
Please let me go.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
The marble?
I don't know.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
It's in the main ballroom.
What?
No.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
You don't?
But it's light in there now.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Like what?
All right. Now finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
How are you?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Why don't you watch?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
If you want.
Anything. Anything at all.
How about art.
Don't you?
Do you want to hear it or not?
What?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Well how long has this been going on.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
At college.
I'm curious.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Well, I'm not.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Did I say that?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
You don't have to say that.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I don't believe you.
Go home now.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Sure.
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
When did you two talk this over?
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Oh no.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
No, it's not --
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
HUH?
Mrs. Robinson?
Can you see me now?
I want to speak --
No.
Why?
How?
I don't like your tone.
Reducing?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
So alone.
Strange man...
You are beautiful!
Really?
No?
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I know.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
Why?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Well -- last night was not so good.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
Oh yes, of course.
Do you like me better?
What?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Then, it's all over?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
I wish to be alone.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Pimenov.
I don't know you.
What is this insolence?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Yes, I know them --
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Well, make it stop!
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
All right.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Bluebell came in?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
What's that?
Expecting visitors?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I've really got to --
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You're getting off the grift?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I can't. I just left home.
Are you sure?
Look at me.
I want to know everything about you.
Every day in every way.
The long end. Big con.
And when he got serious?
Where?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Oh, Jesus.
Why am I here?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No.  Wait for the police.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Where are you going?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
He found you, didn't he?
I'm not leaving without her.
Why not?
I can see that.  Why?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I can't believe this is happening.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
Mommy!!!
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
God ... this can't be true.
Where's the baby?!
What now?!
Come on!
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
Yes?
We've never met.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Tell them yourself!
Go home!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
And how were things?
Huh.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
I dunno.
Me?
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
How are you, honeybunch?
We got to get another pilot.
What went wrong?
Gee whiz--
Anybody home?
Hello.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College?
Excellent!
No.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
I don't know.
Go on.
You're supposed to get hurt!
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Mom?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Some kind of animal?
We thought a doctor might help.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
You're wrong.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It couldn't!
I don't think so.
Sneaking in the back door.
Unless she has nerve.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
He's a child!
You're begging him to kill you?
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
You have chills?
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You haven't heard me yet.
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
I'm utterly satisfied.
Don't shoot.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
It was a bitch.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
I'm only ten years old.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Because he was cruel?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Yes, he is.
That man is your father.
What?
What does he say to do?
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Did you see him?
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
What?
That's the XKE.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Wait?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
The other girl is the star?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
She's dead.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Tijuana.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Well, what do they know?
You are.
I've got a meeting...
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Wes, do me a favor.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's not true, Mr...?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Sounds all right.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Come again.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Is this your shovel?
No.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
No.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
No. 
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Because they are all the same.
But we can't just dig it up!
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No more revolts.
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Oh.
Maude, I must speak to you.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
I took them out.
It looks like you. Thanks.
Supper for two.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Fifteen.
No.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Yes.
Well, I didn't.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Nonsense, I...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Is he serious??
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
What the hell was that? An ape?
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Reliquary --
Son. About Rasputin --
It's her choice --  She's human --
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Sir, may I go first??
You want me to hold him down?
Out? Out out?
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Just take it slowly.
Hi.
We're leaving.
Who are you?
You remember.
No.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Julia.
No. God no.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Later.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
So you were cheated.
Maybe.
Maybe we should just leave --
No, damn you --
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Where are you?
You're NOT going to faint.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
I'll be down in a minute
Drinking alone.
Just soda.
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
O.K.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Surprise.
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Where are you going?
Oh no?
Oh!
Your father told me you were working here.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
What's wrong?
What did I say?
Say it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Like fuck you are.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
They always seemed...
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Uh.  That's me.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Good weekend?
Are you all right?
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.
Just ask it!
Never?
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
That bad, eh?
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
No, no.  When are you going home?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
What about Ian?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Barry said its done.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Are you persuadable?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
How're you holding up?
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Which way are you going?
How's the store?
So so.  Up and down.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Thirteen hundred.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Basil the II.
Who?
Jesus Christ.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
You've been listening to rumors.
You did kill those men.
Yes.
You're using your son's name.
He is older than I.
Not the same.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
How can you know this?
You know me home.  Me name.
You feel you know me.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You will live.  Survive.
Aye.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Oh please.  Another one.
State of grace and all that.
No doubt.
You're wrong.
We need more time.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Your father must be smart.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
I don't know.
The last four.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Long time.
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Do you?
We were very close.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Yes, wasn't it?
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Where are we going?
No -- she didn't.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
I haven't any hard feelings.
You can break it, can't you?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Where'd you meet this man?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
All the words you've got.
Double-crossing swine!
What happened?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What's the matter with my brains?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
What a chase!
Gus, this --
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Just a minute, Johnson!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Where is he?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
And so do I!
Got you, Williams!
Five hundred dollars.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Mother!
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Very simple, Earl.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
What's the idea?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I know a secret.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
What's that?
Where?
Why not?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Well?
What are you going to be then?
What did he say?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
I'd like to see that.
You shouldn't a done that.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Perfect.
How awesome?
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Forget it. I'll just go.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Goddamn.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
A couple hours!
What'd ya got there?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Firefly.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Just back up.
Huh?
Sorry.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
What about the body you found?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I guess not.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.
Please. I look a mess.
No!
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
No.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
He's dead.
Ouch. Yeah?
Won't he be able to tell?
Three foot one.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Yes, darling.
Absolutely.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Who from work?
Your entire body?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
That's great.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
I think he's ready.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Puff, put the gun down.
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
Are you ready for another?
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
How're the hands?
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Please don't get off me now.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
The expensive kind.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Who's he?
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Couple of bucks.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Shoot.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
How long you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
Have a nice trip.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Why did you do that?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Who is it?
What happened?
You wanna drink?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Well, what else does?
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Why?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Your shot.
You name it.
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You want to find them.
Who?
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
Yes.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
What did it look like?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I swear it was here.
You're looking for life?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What's his family background?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You have to leave the White House.
He's a good man.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Spunky. He told you about that?
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
What's the bad news?
That signal. It's a countdown.
It's perfect the line is busy?
This I can see.
Thanks, Pops.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
With their shields down it might be possible.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
You can't go. Call them back.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You're late.
Sorry for what?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Stevie... I can't...
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Why did you people come here?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
DONOVAN!
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
It must be one of these...
You said go between them!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What do you know about this place?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
You came back for the book? Why?
Dad!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Well, what was left of him.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
Umh?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
What???
What?
I'm going after those horses.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
My name is Kazim.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Charming.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
You got the tickets, Short Round?
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
No, the stones are mine!
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A what...?
PET IT??!!
It's starting to let go!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Figures...
Give me your hat...
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Where are we now?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Me? What'd I do?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Are you crazy?
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
Behind us?
Did you hear that?
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean?
I'm back.
Who is it?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What about money?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
I'll get in trouble.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Eat it.
Try another language.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Even Rene?
I don't know!
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Osaka.
Osaka?
On what?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What next!
While he makes the run.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Do it.
Aim just in front of his face.
What happened?
I can always flush you down the toilet.
She works for them.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
Can you fly this?
I didn't do anything.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
That name's familiar.
What about it?
How do I look?
Well what?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Joe.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Why would we want to hurt you?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Blake?
Let you leave without it.
...Naw. Made that up.
Why did they leave?
Who did?
You're leaving.
This business is over.
He must be a good friend.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
I asked him.
Now what?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Why not, what are you going to do?
Kiss her you fool.
Now what?
It was you.
Riuji?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
This the only spare?
It'l take months.
I'll take some.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
That remote control thing?
Mom.
How long?
Monday.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Get me Wigand.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
How are you, Jim?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Lowell?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Did you say Berman?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
No, you do not.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Yeah.
So, is everything okay?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Give me a break!
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Good. But Jeff...
No.
What?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Just give me an example...
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
"I would bet on it."
You threatening my family, now, too?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
You want Botox?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
It was a gift from a client.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
What do you mean, was.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
What is it you're after, Miles?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Me. Yes.
She didn't love you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
Huh?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Those are gifts.
You can't prove anything.
Meaning my house.
No buts. Now. Out.
It's not something I wanted either.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Hello, Rex.
Is this a lover?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Mm.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Video.
I am very sorry.
What...?
Extinguish?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Who said anything about a reward!
That's an evasion.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
You ought to know why. Because—
South America!
What've you got against King Westley?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Ellie—
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
No.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
He's marvelous!
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Oh, yeah?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
That's none of your business.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Do you mind putting out the light?
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Where is the shower?
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Of course it is.
That's silly.
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Carrots.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, no!
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
—six—seven—eight—nine—
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I said, the old man's screwy!
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
What's the thousand bucks for?
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Yeah, where am I?
When you sober up—come in and see me.
ain't got a hat—
Send it collect.
Not a minute!
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Yeah—wouldn't it?
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
No, I'm not...
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
I did.
Why?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
No, I did not.
Dave?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Calm down, Dave, what?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
How many shots you say you heard?
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  Never heard of him.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Please answer the question.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Honey, you all right? 
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
My sympathies.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Huh?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
What are you driving at, boss?
Goddamn Sam!
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did. 
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What'd ya mean?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I can't believe you do me this way.
She sound scared?
What's she willing to give us?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not a loser.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He called you?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
What do you do when he comes home?
And is that it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Uh-huh.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I never lied to you.
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
We can look into that.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Uh-huh.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
Kinda.
Yeah, do you like it?
I knew it.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
You told em? You told em it's me?
No, I give it to someone else first.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
What does she think she's gettin?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
It's a diet thing?
Which one?
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
I lived there for about nine months.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
And your point is?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
That's good money.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
That was Beaumont.
What did he do?
Yeah.
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You know how she is.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Then what?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Watcha gonna see?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
That's Winston. He works here.
It's in my bag.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Yes.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I got some more business for ya.
You didn't hear?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Did the police contact you?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Where is it?
You know who this is?
In a way, yes.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
You sure?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
He ain't here right now.
Get me out of here.
Let me out of here!
Are you all right?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Don't go.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
What do you mean, demons?
Her knee acting up?
What did she have to say?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
What are you doing?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Hell, you think I am?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What do you think?
The room!
The best.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
WHO ARE YOU?
Long time ago.
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Dream on!
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
You've seen them?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
He doesn't like it.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Okay, enough of this shit.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
What?
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Creepy.
Shit!
I'll need system four converters.
Done!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
I am an expert!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
What the hell are you doing?
Yllo, what's your head count?
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Rizzo?!
See? We're not so bad.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
You lost the charge?
Now this is getting exciting.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
I'm gonna spew.
Jesus!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Am I in there?
Do I have to?
We're missing two of the kids!
I gotta go back.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Azrael can you repeat that?
What good will that do?
More soldiers?
Can we get through these?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
What's that one, there?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Colorful, isn't he?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
He lost it on the way up.
Got a pen on you?
Why?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Chum?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Let it go, don't waste your time.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
What can that gun of yours do?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Oh.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Junk?
What is it?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
What?
What's the matter?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
What...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
There are ads? For parents?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
A Pilates machine?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Hi, I'm Adele.
...Yeah.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You took this picture?
Hold still.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Where you from Walter?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Now why is that?
If you say so.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Up yours.
Fuck!
Who said he's my good buddy?
There's more...
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Nervous?
Early, just think...
You were plenty hot.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Shit.
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Probably.
It is right.
You down with the boost?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Can you do it man?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Good luck?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Nah.
Why not? You stink.
Casper! Was up kid?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
But I'm scared Telly.
I wouldn't believe it?
Do you care about me?
What?
Sorry.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Did you bleed?
You didn't?
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
No. I was just kidding.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
Right.
It was... it was.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
We seem to have a little problem here?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What do you mean, no?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
What?
Then what's he talking about?
Yes you are.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Just like who?
I'm just trying to play the game.
Have you any idea what the message is?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
I've figured out the message.
It's me you want.  Not her.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Has he gotten through to any?
What is it, dad?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
No prints.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
A building?
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Are we going to go through this again?
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Uh huh.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
No.
Doesn't that scare you?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
What is this?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Why not?
It could be anything.
Are you going to come tonight?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I lied.
Have they harmed you?
You will go alone.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
They know when they're going to die?
I cannot reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Yes.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
Use your sword.
Each to his fate.
Yes.
Even by you?
To the place where Death lives.
Hand over your dinner.
You!
A small house.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
We meant only to please you.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Oh, my poor stew!
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
I knew.
A fine match.
Yes. We lost five.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Who speaks that name!
But you would not stay with me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
What's that man's name?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You don't believe me, don't you?
When I say I love you.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
No...
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Are you a preacher?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You do?
I've seen it before.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
It's a special day isn't it?
Ellen?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
That's okay -- really it is.
I know where my heaven is.
Yes.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Perhaps there's another route?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What happened?
Yes.
Why know?
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I need your help.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
What do you want?
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
You're pretty drunk.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
No?
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Will you lighten up, please?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Where have you been staying?
Where have you been?
That's right.
It's so shameful...
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
Why the hell not?
Is everything okay?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
What did you see when you entered the house?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
-- his life?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
The idiot speaks.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Picking out my wedding dress!
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Don't ask.
Aside from that.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
You really think I'm attractive?
Whoa -- Why?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
What're you doing here?!
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
You got into Harvard Law?
Thank you. Having fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
My generosity is not so large as that.
Protection?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Faerie ring?
It's bluebells!
What!
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
But... but, why?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
What do I do?
Something the matter?
I should hope not!
Will you chance a miss?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Can you save her?
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
These for me?
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I'll go search for it.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
What have I done?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Lili... I love you!
Everywhere!  Ow!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Is she fair, this princess?
Dead, dead, dead.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Do I not please you, Jack?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
You... you... you mortal you!
The fastest in the world.
What's she doing?
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
What color?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Why?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Where's your dad?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Will he talk to me?
A violation?
And if I enclosed it?
I have the permit.
Pardon me?
Right...she married...what was he?
Oh.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
I've got one favor to ask.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I can promise you complete privacy.
Where are you going?
A friend of yours is here.
Sit down for a second.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
He's got nothing to do with me.
After everything.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
Are you taking them still?
I need you to do me a favor.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
He never answers.
What?
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
I don't have a phone.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Which?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
What have you been before today?
I dreamed about your house last night.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
You've never said that before.
You got any weed?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
Where are the kids?
Do it now!
Hey.
What are you doing in my room?
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Nagger?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I'm talking about a haircut.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Yeah...
Take care of me?
Want me to come back some other time?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
I got it... boss.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Don't I know you?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Guess we better get going, huh?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
This fork is filthy.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do you want, Claude?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Say what?
You get ketchup?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
That was five years ago.
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
What'd you say?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
You got your own nightclub?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
So it don't exist.
They gave me life, mama.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Wait for the firemen!
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Are you offering me a bribe?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Understood.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Is this a joke?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
My mom wasn't a goat?
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
So go get 'em, Dad!
You came through, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
If you want to.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
..."The Devil?"...
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Yes. What is rent?
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Just the face.
Had enough?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Who invited you?
Of course.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
Well then...?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I changed my mind.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Please? What friends?
That's tomorrow.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
Will you take me with you?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
To what?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
No.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Not yet.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Do you own a video camera?
What's that, Ed?
So what do we do?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Are you my man?
Sure.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Please tell me.
The wife killer?
His condition? What do you mean?
You just gonna let him go?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
What's the matter?
What is this, Rogoff?
Who is this man?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
That's why I married you.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I can see that.
You like pornos?
Suit yourself, champ.
Yeah.
What do you want?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Well, what do you know about that!
Found in Asia!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Oh, really?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Certainly not.
The police?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Say, what about that gold deal?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Nothing. Why?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Centuries.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Very often.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Oh, immediately.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
You're wrong, George.
The clothes?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
What is it?
How about you? Do you want to go?
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
We wear black.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Something's wrong here.
Gee.  You really think?
Kay--
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Since how long?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
How could it not?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nowhere.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
I dunno. One?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Will it lower the curve?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
This it?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Drop some money.
Forget that guy --
Please --
Oh, God...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Where are we going?
I have to go back.
She died?
John?  What is it?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
It's all I could safely move.
I put you away --
You made those tapes...
You set your patients on fire!
The nano... what?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
What?
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
You're kidding, that's today?
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
No maglev system.
What?
Sir?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Are these all of her previsions?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Stop --
Sean -- you're not real.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Heal who?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
So you won't help me?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Good God.  What was that?
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
No, I wanna kill my boss!
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
We can stop him.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Raincheck?
Yeah.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
What's 'incidentals?'
Not on me, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
She's, uh, sleeping.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Hello.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I want you to quit.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah, sure.
You driving her?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
So, when's the drop.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Why?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
It's important.
What about boxing?
What about it?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
It's not even yours.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
This is bullshit, man.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
We need guns.
You're out of money?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
What about it?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
No. I'll wait here.
I want to leave right now.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes?
It means you got a gun?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
I'm half Irish.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Coke?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Yeah.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Who's gonna outfit us?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Dip?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Elijah who?
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Is the program ready?
I can handle it.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
I'm in Detroit.
I just want to sit here and be still.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
Brother Earl.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Entirely.
Let me do it then.
I say a lot of things.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I ain't stupid.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
Me?
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
I don't know shit about you.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[Senor?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Who ordered it?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Lucky how?]
[And?]
[Don't lie to me!]
You been working?
Yes or no?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
Potential? I don't understand.
It's better to be free, right?
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Sorry.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
You should be sleeping, baby.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I think it's fantastic.
He has to go, Samuel.
[I know this. Your point?]
I told you she wasn't attractive...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Who told you that?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Marty.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Wadda you think?
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
I'm afraid of being lonely.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
No, Marty, please...
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
It's loaded with what?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
Hiya, Ralph...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
That's all right, that's all right...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yes, O'Reilly?
What are you going to do with him?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
That's right.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Us. Lead us not into...
You got directions?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Sixteen times.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
When will he be able to write?
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
But what about Major Houlihan?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
I think we could still have a chance.
What's the matter?
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Just in dreams?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Hello, John.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Thank you very much for everything.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
John Doe.
Who, for instance?
Plus a bonus.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh, let me go, will you!
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Where is she?
Ba-ll!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Hello, Mr. Connell.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Well, I don't get it.
Huh? Get what?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Nineteen!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
How?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Yeah.
Shh!
What?
SWAT wants to go in.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Where's the stereo?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
Where's the car?
Who are you again?
You signed out twice.
...a car.
Being faxed over now.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Yep.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
So what do I say to this guy?
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
He's got the girl.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Greg.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
A deeper level?
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Tell him to give me a raise.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
You let us worry about that.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Who's running it!
There are two million people in there with you.
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Wake up?!
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Only up there in the dream they called life.
And what about the reconfiguration?
You've got the keys, send someone in --
That's right.
There was no need to kill her.
Insurance?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Why?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
I'm sorry.
Why not?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
... What's happening to him?'
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
Where did it originate?
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Here you go!  No pushing!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
How the heck?!...
And I ain't no nigger either!
You own a hotel, sir?
So Chicago's been good to ya.
So what happened?
No. Not everything.
I got my partner in there!
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
No. They envy you.
You could have stopped him.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
I'm doin' business here!
I been thinkin'...
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Uh huh. And?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
I might wake up.
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
But I was dusting.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
This way?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
It was?
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Would you settle for a husband?
What's this, Diz?
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
What! Who?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
What?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
That infernal phone!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
He's batty!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
I did. What about it?
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will he yield for a question?
Will the Senator--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Did you say--bus?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Some committee's got it.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
I did--and--and I got right up.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
You--don't know it, do you?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Sure.
I'm splendid, too.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
Order, gentlemen!
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Ax?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
You want to see me, Senator?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Maybe he won't get up.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Senator Paine.
Order!
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
NO!!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Tell me more about yourself.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There's Times Square.
Oh, that—
Oh, I don't know.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Hello, Mary?
Good night.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Yes.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Me sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
Better wire him right away, John.
Relatives of old man Semple.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
Must we have the echo?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yes.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Yes. That is to say—
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Why should you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Your Honor—
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Uh-huh.
Binge?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
I'm fine.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Where's your wife, Henry?
Go to hell.
What's that?
I feel like we're making real progress here.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
You like me. How come?
And the Brocketts?
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Don't need it.
What's wrong with her?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
We don't discuss it.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
I've offended you!
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
Transference.
Hello.
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
Will you be here?
It's my bit for the community.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Do you think that's what he wants?
Would you like another beer?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Is that the question?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Uh-huh.
Just you.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
At least you pulled yourself out...
And the drugs?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Yes... your particular approach.
Relax, I got him.
And how does one do that?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
What does he want the book for?
Intestines.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Where are they taking him?
What are you doing here?
No, I mean --
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
You know your history.
That "thing" gets me excited.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Something like that.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
No... Why?... Should I?
It's everybody's problem!
I'm staying.
I think you were jealous
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I'm your sister.
None taken.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
I thought you were done?
Come on, baby!
How about... the Savage Six?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Thanks.
He's dead.
He'll never make it.
Have you considered my offer?
I got it.
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
It's me.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
You're the Sphinx.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
So what else has Superman got?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Or flowers.
Maybe she's right.
Agents?
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
But... only when no one is looking.
The Obliterators!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We've got lift off!
Through there!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
What do you have in mind?
There are none here.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, I am.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
What is that?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
No, sir.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Thank you, Napoleon.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No...
Not even the slightest hint of something?
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Will you use the troops?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
No.
Promise me you will never leave me.
I will never forgive you.
Promise.
Promises mean nothing.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
What are you talking about?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What?
What was there to tell?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You could hear them?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
No.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Come in.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
I don't play for no team.
What is it?
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Nice to meet you?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Call me.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Debo!  Debo!
Ezal!  Ezal!
Huh?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Need to lose some weight.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
What's he doing here?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
My security people are right next door.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
I remember you...in the elevator.
And your husband works for somebody else.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Can we go now?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
What would you do in my place?
But...
I think you better put that away.
On TV.
No way.
Nods.
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Oh, man...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Cover your mouth.
Who?
Oh, Jesus ...
Gimme a dollar.
What?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
I'm looking for them.
Yeah.
What do you figure he done with it?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You understand?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Uncle Birdie!
Don't!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
About what!
Who?
John don't like him much.
You go set down by the River.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
I tried to save her.
You better not sing that song.
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
Why?
Where ye from?
Up river.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Nothin'!
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
What secret shall I tell?
Sure, that's no secret.
Why, pray tell?
No. No one never did.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Mornin', ladies.
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
How can you tell?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
Meanwhile...?
How you doing, pal?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Where you think you're going?
Right home after.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Feeling better?
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
No.
Rod says the sweetest things.
You feel better now, right?
What is it, Ninotchka?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Tell me... what else did you have?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Just for the honeymoon.
That's her.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
Have you?
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Is this satisfactory?
We can wait.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
If there is anything we can do for you...
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
What business?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
I must get into that country of yours!
Oh no. No visa.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
No.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Ni-notchka.
Don't do it, please.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Room service speaking.
Must one always be after something?
What?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
On which boat?
I have never heard one.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Did you make any change in this room?
You must, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Our salute will be a kiss.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Yes, sweetheart. 
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Oh, Leon!
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Months, Swana.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
All right, I'll listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Has done what?
Hello.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Where are they?
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Cigarette?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Père Mathieu's.
Where is that?
Your Highness.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
You did say it, sir.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
We could get that.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
I understand that, sir.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
Yeah?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Mitchell?
Pay him.
I thought the gloves were off.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
There's no secrets here, Al.
I don't have a pistol.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
I did?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Fucking hell.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Money.  Follow the money.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Sir?
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
Because they're not Americans.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What'd he say?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
What?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
... little Bobby.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
Mein Kampf?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
That's right.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
I know ...
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Are you serious?
You don't have to go.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
It'll be over soon.
Lost.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
How'd you know I was here.
You heard it?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
You ain't heard from him?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Yes ma'am?
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
I thought it was a car afire.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
I got it Mama.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Goin' out.
So... for how long do we have to...
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
You should be used to that.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know something better.
Where does he work?
Hello?
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
Who is this.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Sixty-nine cent.
You married into it.
You married into it.
Yes.
Just call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Everything.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
One room, one night.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Okay.
Well enough.
Another additional.
Waitin' for my wife.
Then you'll like me.
Not that way.
I been immobile.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Could I have that in American?
...I meant your food.
...plenty
Anyway, so what?
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
"Thirty-two?"
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I better go check on them.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Yes, ma'am.
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Lyla's very nice.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Sure you don't want any salad?
What?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I came for love...
Make sure it's elevated...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Los Angeles, California.
Did you love it?
Like Rome?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
He has no heartbeat!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Doctor David Ravell.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Does he know you think he's real?
Your husband?!
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Like what?
I... I don't know...
Hell of a way to die.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
How'd they describe her?
No.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
It just didn't fit her profile...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Oh, five years, give or take.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
What'd you get her?
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Can I have an evil twin?
I don't know, George...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Is there a problem, George?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
No... before that.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
You lie, motherfucker...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Yeah?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
How'd he know about the treasure?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
What's his name again?
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Not out the other side his face, though.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
- in the gods - Huh?
Uh-huh.
That don't make no sense!
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Who's the honcho around here?
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
...Yeah?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
She's at the five and dime.
I been calling for four months.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
When did this happen?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I want to fly jets, sir!
No, sir!
Pity you don't have the character.
Mayo, are those your friends?
No.
No, sir.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Something tells me you've been here before.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
He ask you out for next weekend?
You hope.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah? Why're you here?
There's always a choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You're better than candy.
Want me to get a towel?
What's the matter?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Yes.
What?  What do you want me to do?
This is ridiculous...
The hell does she want?
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Hey.
We'd like to come in.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
That door is a safely hazard.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Cut it back a little bit.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Shoulda got an apartment.
It doesn't work?!
Shaky?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What are you doing?
He --
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
So... we understand each other Judge?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Get out of the car.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... I gotta...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
We're working on that...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
So what's the deal?
I don't know about that.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
This cool the heat off you any?
What?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You don't know him very well, do you?
Excuse me?
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
The middle colonies?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
What now, sir?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
How old are you?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Father?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
And what do they know?
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
You don't hate him.
Please.
And your principles?
We saw.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Don't touch him.
Don't worry.
That bad?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Well...I guess not.
Yes, but the rope might be--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Because you promised.
Huh?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
God, that's fine.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
It's Church.
I'm not climbing that.
Almost there, Louis.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The movers--
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Getting there.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You have a name, missy?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Boy overboard!
That would hardly be proper.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
What?  He never told me that.
We're not going to just surrender!
What's your name?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Somewhat.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Is that so?
That's not true.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
What happened here?
Commodore --
But --
Please.
Speak.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
I know what you're doing.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Icky!  What's happening?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Why are there two ottomans?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
That might work.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Aaabout...?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Well, you got another problem.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
When did you...?
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
You don't know?
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
We don't have time for hysterics.
What are these?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Three days ago it was.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
Blame the victim.
What's wrong?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Things do change.
Oh yes you are!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
You were looking for us?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
That's considerate of you.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Your place?
Of course I am Stewart.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I poisoned him.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
You're the Tribune man?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yale '21, I believe.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Why not?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
A what?
Who are you?
Dawson, sir.
Yes.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
—and that—
There you go, talking like a woman!
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
What other girl—?
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Well, at best you might deny it.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Did you call, sir?
Me, sir?
Found no skeletons?
Yes.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Bud?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
Are you alright?  What is it?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
What happened?
We're supposed to be in school.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Jen, listen ...
It's in your closet.
What did you do to him?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
And you're sure about this?
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
How?
Where are they?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Where are you going ...
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
What's wrong?
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
... Yeah.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Just listen to me ...
It's an art book.
Yeah ...
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
That's it.
Somewhere in Utah.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
You just said very food.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
It's not cool?
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
I....please don't do this.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
You're going to work now?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
They're not open yet?
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Yeah.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You see?
That was good.
Yeah.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
I just wanted to make sure.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Ok.
Did you do it?
I know.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Yes it is.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your name?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Yeah.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
You're goin' on a trip?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Please don't do this.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Are you serious with this?
Seven o'clock.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Hello?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Yes, Abbe?
Free his mouth.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
There I was taxed; it's true.
Good day, Marquis.
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
It's no secret that you loved her.
It's a formality; truly.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Do you favor its publication?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Well?
And --?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
As for the author... shoot him.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
I pray you: be succinct.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Good God, Marquise --
I'd rather read, thank-you.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
There. That's right.
How bad is it?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are repellant when you drink.
I just want to understand--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Why did we not know about this sooner?
I can't remember the lines!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
What are movies about, Orson?
What are movies about?
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Like a bug.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
How?

Did I ever tell you about my father?
Hey, kid. Gregg.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
So they're Jews. . .
What does this have to do with--?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Please don't ask me to do this.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
We done?
Oh, no--
Yes!
He's Christ?
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
This looks done.
What's wrong?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
How do you know? You know her that good?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
You wasn't with her?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
You want the title shot or not?
What did Tommy say?
C'mon, Joey.
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Whatsa matter with you?
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Does that mean...
At night?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
I like the gym smell.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
What?
You asleep?
Yeah, what?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I say?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
With Salvy, eh?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Why don't you just call him?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is the baby sitter.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Like disposing of their wives?
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
I think they missed their chance with her.
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Read some good books.
I'll send you some comic books.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Something wrong?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
No.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
We've progressed emotionally in --
How did you know!
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Huh?
You can tell that from here?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Not yet, Jeff.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
We have all -- what?
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
What for?
Feel okay?
What?
Machismo?
Just him.
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
That's funny!
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
John Crawford?
How'd you get here?
I hitched.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
There's only one key.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
My gun?
What?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Get lost.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
They never do.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
What a zoo!
If he could--
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Oh, Jim!
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
After he tried to shoot you?
Yes.  My best friend.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
You said you'd call my father.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Gabriel -- !
Read a lot about you, Nick.
A man of some travels.
Gabriel, you promised!
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
No, Nick, no --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
I love you, Nick...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
He wants to see your map.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
You're not Nick Mason...
Yes!
What's her greatest fear?
Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
You do.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
What's the code?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No, you're not.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Yeah.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Who, Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
The Brewers.
What's this?
But what is this?
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
What do you care?
You gonna put it away?
Like hell I am.
Aren't you?
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Down to my car.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
I'm okay.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
I don't know anybody.
Why!
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
It doesn't matter who they are.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Don't you trust me?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Why?
Yes.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
How'd you happen to miss?
Can I have my gun back?
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Yeah, it does.
Finished, son?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Kind of sore.
All right, you didn't know.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Even women?
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
And we're running out of that.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
We got to get movin'.
Put on another one.
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Gee, I can't.
That's the end of the line.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
And you've got me all figured out?
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
I found a picture of his wife.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Ray, run faster.
Yeah.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
Let's get outta here.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, look out, a bee!
Okay, I get the point.
Where's Shorty?
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
This can't be happening?
What the hell are you doing?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
You could use the grade, huh?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What are you working on?
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
You never could feel your legs.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No thanks.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mrs. Sutphin?
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Chip, honey?
But Mom, the video's not over.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm so happy I could shit.
CHIP!!
Detectives, what is this about?
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Objection! Argumentative!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Marvin A. Pickles.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
It's him!
You got your wish.
...Browsing.
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
You scared?
I'd like to get out of here.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
About forty-five dollars.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
No!
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
And the other was Judd?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
It seems right to us.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
But she was here?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Ann?
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
This food is excellent.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
What?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
What are these?
Like what?
To you?
This is just... so...
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Don't you want to make one?
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Did you have sex before you were married?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
That's correct.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
If you were in love with me, would you?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
I don't know. Possibly.
Like maybe a big part?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Yes. I just got busy.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Something wrong?
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I'm not either!!
You've made your point.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Goddam right.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
When did you begin having this feeling?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Yes.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
What's wrong with that?
I don't want to talk about it.
Because I wanted to.
It's a sun dress.
I get real busy between two and four.
There's a phone here.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Your first sexual experience.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you like the way I look?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I've got to get back to the office.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Maybe.
You know what I mean.
Hello.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Right.
It'll just be me.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
No, nothing.
You knew these people?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Anything wrong?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
Who was she?
Huh?
How did you come by this scenario?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
I'd forgotten.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
BRAD!
Fast!
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
So I guess that's it.
Highliner.
Bottle.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
What?
How old's she going to be?
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Let me call Christine.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Huh.
Whoa.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
We were supposed to play golf.
Count me out.
I will.  See ya!
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
With Maya.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
No.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Whatever. Sorry.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Yeah, I know.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Hello?
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I'm pregnant.
How much skin and stem contact?
About a year.
French or American?
I told you I need a drink.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
It tastes funny.
I don't want you to die.
Do you think it's a possibility?
How can you say that?
Should we turn off the lights?
How many died?
No.
Graham.
Yes.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
What's that?
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
And three weeks.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Is that him?
I think we lost 'em.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Sounds good.
Where are we?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
You must have known that before you came.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
Yeah?
I'll see you around.
Where is Rae?
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
What now?
Where's your brother?
You wanted to see me?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
You're kidding.
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
What makes you think I could?
I got there just short of too late.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
This is a lot of money.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
The picture's dead.
Almost right.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Even the fall from the plane.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
-- I can explain.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Not quite.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
So you did meet her?
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Body double.
Hal, what are you doing?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
I know what you mean.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
You want me to call Security?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
Why?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
I could get the death penalty.
What?!
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
I know what you're up to.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Why?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
You're in breach.
A star is...
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
No.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
--What?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
You were great in the play, Cole.
Really?
What?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
A lady. She died.
They?
They want me to do things for them.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
What--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
Superstition.
What's a "little while?"
I happen to be a professional.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
About what?
Getting ready.
No --
Mac... let's get out of here.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
How are you going to find him?
Sorry.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
You took Bill.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Are you nodding?
Hey there, Chief.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Praise Jesus.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
So tell me about yourself.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Jesus!!!
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Mississippi's the other way!
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Let's hit it.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I'm proud of you.
And?
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
See ya, Bandit.
Why should I?
What's your pleasure?
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Shit! No one's here.
Let's get the hell outta here.
You can't swear on these.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
-- How we doing?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Yeah, but...
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Where the hell are you?
Oh.
Of course. Yes.
And a very bad gamble.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
How bad?
Who?
You're sure?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
I'm not doing cocaine.
I'm here, where's the car?
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
It's the last place they'd look.
Where's Israel?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What's wrong?
I DON'T KNOW!
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
A puppet.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I want to hear your version.
That's fantastic.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
Shut up.
I wish you'd told me.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What plan?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
Stop it.
Is it a planet?
Then it's God, right?
What does Snow think you should do?
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
What's wrong?
Thank you.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
I'm supposed to call in.
Put it on my account, please.
You all right?
Listen, that was my fault.
No dog.
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Long enough.
Everyone's all right...?
I don't know...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Coming to bed?
What did you watch?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Ellie...
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Yes.
... Hard?
You're here 'til what time?
How do you know where the gun is?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Shooting?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Lizzy!
Harry…
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Lemme down, bugface!
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He knew.
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
What are you doing this weekend?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So you've found Thorkel?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
The record--
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
I asked if you felt like a drink--
You're sure you're all right.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Bonkers.
What's wrong with him?
Any news on Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Coming up.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Then we're all in on it?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
You were saying --?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
You can say that again!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
What do those broads say?
It's that song, Harry!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
What about Schulz?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Yeah?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
From a chicken, bug-wit.
It's working.
Where is he now?
Data, are you all right?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Antonia?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
I thought you might.
Kirk here.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Understood. That will be all.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Response?
Locate.
Could it be Spock's?
I don't believe it...
David!... What went wrong?
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Why would you do this...?
Yes, yes, Spock...
The word, sir?
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
See! That shimmering area.
Would you look at that?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Who is this?! How dare you --

I -- saw no future --
But -- why?
Yes...
... Or the one.
So!  Speak!
Understood, my lord.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
How is that...?
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Khan could be down there!
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Maybe...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They're still running with shields down.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
You earned it.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Yes.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
That's crazy!
... My shoes...
You're joking...!
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
We're just -- observing.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Back to San Francisco.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Thanks. Cheers.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
But Kirk...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Where are you going?!
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I meant --
They did, Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
What is it?
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Admiral! There be whales here!
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
... Yes?
That's the ticket, laddie.
They are my friends.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Deceive us?
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
You're what?
Really.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
I don't believe it happened that way.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
You got me, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
One. It's Ru'afo.
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Dispersive armor is holding.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
This must be it.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
You seem to have an answer for everything.
What do you want?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
You're lying.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
That's impossible.
Why?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
We have to stop them from sending that message.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Mr. President.
Good luck, Captain.
Uh, Jim...
No!
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
You feign ignorance?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
And what did they tell you?
Torpedo room--?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Your friends are late...
How did you know...?
Except us.
Sorry -
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Why would they give them to us?
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
But I am not human. I am only -
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Channel open, Captain.
Faith...?
Her own father...?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
A lie?
I don't want to.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
And this makes you "sad"?
Now, you make a toast.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
I'm going to miss you.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
Do you have life support?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
How long until he can fire?
New Praetor?

Captain!
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Not very chatty.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
We need to talk, just you and I.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Long ago.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
And?
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I have a purpose.
Praetor.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
I make maps.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
No!!! No!!!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Clarify that.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
This is George Fox...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mrs. Haydn...
What?
Pancakes.
What?
Smile... good?
No gas.
A drink.
What's the matter?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
No.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Why?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
That was beautiful.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I must meet my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
What?
You don't forget anything, do you?
I know how to gamble now.
Yes.
This is yours...
Help me!!
Help me!!!
My grandmother's rich.
They after you?
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
You get that, Lyman?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
You married, Major?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Where are you going?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
Tonight.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Who did it?
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
I won't say anything.
Who was just here?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Sleaze to peddle.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
That would be no.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
So the guy's not a sicko.
That's where it gets a little strange.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
Mace... you're a girl.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Just Lenny.
What is that?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Hey, Sheriff.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
What?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Yeah.
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What are you...?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Thanks for the ride.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
You got a point there.
What's that?
He thinks he looks young.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
It's a no-no.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Just routine stuff.
Sue Ann Hanson.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Suspect Zero.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Tom, you okay?
You okay?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
Jaime --
Unlock these cuffs.
Who are you?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Maybe you should back off.
Was it Zero?
I've been to Chicago.
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
Yes, sir.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
How far is Amarillo?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I'm Mike.
How was it hard?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
No.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Could you believe it?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
How are you doing?
Really?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Right.
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
I mean, I need the money.
I didn't want to say anything.
Oh no?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Oh.  Where is this place?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Oh, like that song...
Then why won't she call...?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
What's he do?
She was cute.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
They're all skanks.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You think they're watching?
What?!?
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
Did she, or did she not smile.
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Nice, baby.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
...So give me the fuckin part...
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
That was different.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What?!?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
She didn't see.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
It's on.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...you're money...
...Sue...
It's on...
What was that?
You heard about your father?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
You look terrif on the floor!
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
I know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Things went badly in Palermo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
One of Tattaglia's people?
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Will you give this to him.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
What about McCluskey?
How will they come at you?
They're waiting to see my father.
Who is he?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
How do you do.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Michael?
Huh?
Please say it.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
How's Mom?
Send some bodyguards.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You're unlucky.
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
We?
You'd say if you mind?
Marge, you like everybody.
Who's this?
Can you mix a martini?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Your parents met her.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
That's good.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
What?
So tell me.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I never said that!
Dickie did it.
That's a terrific idea.
He's having an early night.
What?
You've got Dickie's rings.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
How would you know that?
Where's Dickie's father?
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Dickie, my God!
Ditto.
My God.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Peter, I... I...
You're such a liar...
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I don't remember the exact date.
You got a .44 Magnum?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Huh?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Really?
The moon?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
It keeps ya busy.
What?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
But this is a porno movie.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Well... I guess so.
A girl needs protection.
Listen...
You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?
Don't you want to go?
Who's a killer?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
How?
You're not much with girls, are you?
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
Why should it be grounded?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
You want to work uptown nights?
Education?
Military record?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Limp dick?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
You mean,  me?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
You look... different.
I do?
City hall?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Yes, sir.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Ha!
I'm here.
What.
Evening, Luke.
You kids off to the dance?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Exactly.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
That was beautiful.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Thank you.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Look.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Miss Daniels?
I don't think your mother would like that.
Mitch, let's turn back.
Right across the bay there.
And the white house?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
And certainly pretty.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Yes?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
But they'll be back.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I don't mind, really.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Sixty...  Oh.
What?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Doesn't what make me...?
How can you tell?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Why... 
Yes?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
With... with Annie, of course.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Seven o'clock then.
No.
Yes, I was lying.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
Helping travelers.
What?
Do you want some mustard with this?
It smelled of the fire.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
What time is it?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
For what purpose?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I want you to help my little girl.
You have his promise, then?
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
I'm cold as ice.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
He was a nice horse.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
But where did they get those people?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Where are they?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Think maybe knives do?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
What Scar? What fucking scar?
The scar.
Fuck. Me.
Are you ok?
Fucking crow.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
Such power exists?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No foolin'? Will you?
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
Just Klaatu.
You must have come a long way.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
You know about the United Nations?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Well, we could--
You ready?
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Everyone seems so-- 
What happened?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Time to activate Plan B.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
I will, David!
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Thanks, Grandpa...
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
He looks dead.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
I'll hitch.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Smells like something died.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
He met a girl.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
You're cute, Max.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Does it burn?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
This is kind of a cool place.
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Who are you calling?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Cut him loose?
MacReady!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What we going to do?!
What?
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What clothes?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Hey, man...!
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
You jerking off or just pissed?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Yes.  Just about here.
Morlocks --
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Yes.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Created?
As slaves.
How do you control the Morlocks?
Say I just come back again?
So you take their best...
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
I'm tired of running.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
You promised me flowers.
Talk away, Professor.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
You're late.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Alex... people are staring.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
In the future, we'll be better.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
You won't say that in a week.
How long did you travel?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
You're not from beyond the valley.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
That machine --
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Is he all right?
We all have that dream.
What's it all for?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Alexander...?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Mara...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
May I get you some --
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
And hungry, I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Why?
Where do they take them?!
If I might explain, sir --
We'll see about that.
But... what about Starks?
We never should have done this to him...
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
In where?
My business?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What for?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
I know.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
They're not.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
No. I don't want it to.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Beat] How do you know?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Why "of course"?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Hon.
What.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
What?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Who do you think did it?
You girls are in some hot water.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
No!
I have no problem with that.
Armed robber.
What's wrong?
What for?
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
What the fuck is going on?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Will you at least see how it fits?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Is this your car?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
How come he let you go?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
Did you finish thinking?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
It's probably not a good idea.
What did Darryl say?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Try to.
I want you to call Darryl.
Why not?!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Just past Boise City.
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
You mean now or before?
This is so beautiful.
Thelma!
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
What'd I say again?
I said all that?
He said they're charging us with murder.
Eeuww.
Me too.  I feel awake.
It'd have to be pretty good.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Louise!
Go.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
Say you're sorry.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi there!  You alright?
We're fine!  How are you?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Never?
I mean since then.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
What?
Shoot.
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
I work with retards.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
No.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
What's that supposed to mean?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
I think you'd better sit down.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
So who you taking to the prom?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
So you're a writer?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Go!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Oh God.
How are you doing, Warren?
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Yes, sir.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
My father --
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
How long until the army is ready?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Should be here any minute.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Let's get out of here.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I know, I know...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
I see.
A murder. On the reservation.
What's this about?
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
How'd you know?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
Why does he wanna see me?
He said he doesn't know.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Not no more.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Go ahead, Ray.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You saw a MiG 21?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
I can't.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Make what?
I want it understood.
Where are we?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Goose is dead.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
I hope you find him.
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
MAVERICK.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Well what?
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
The list is long, but distinguished.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
1000.
Mav's a great flyer but....
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I guess I owe you one.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
You didn't help.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
For the same reason you are.
I called your house.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
What to the rebels want?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Fuck you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Stop fighting and get out.
Hetero.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Where?
Shit!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Shit!
He's not at ground level.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Let me go!
Well...What do you say?
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
--I got a trip to Mars.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Doug...Bob McClane.
That a problem?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
...What?
What are you talking about?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
He's lying.
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
She's got my vote.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
You're hung up again.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Down, honey, down.
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Think it's still following us?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
...Where're we goin'?
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
I have to talk to your brother.
Don't hurt him.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
-- Easy as that, huh?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie Dowd.
...What do you mean?
But what?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I don't need sleep!
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
Shu Kai Kim.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
It's okay. It was always like that.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We can do it right here.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Did she have someone with her?
Is there a golf course around here?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
And neither will I.
He didn't suffer.
Ever see her with someone else?
What happened to her?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
What did Gordon's tie mean?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Agent Desmond, it's...
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
You didn't do your homework?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Maybe.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Call me.
Laura?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
What are you doing?
You're not mad at me?
WE got it back, that's all.
Fill 'er up.
Who would do that?
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
James...
Not now.
This afternoon?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Everything, but everything.
You always hurt the ones you love.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Dad.
No.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Leland, what are you doing?
Bobby didn't give you this?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I thought I would need it.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I was her doctor.
Anything special about the case?
Tell me one?
Yes!
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Are you done?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Still looking.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
What...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
What is that to you...?
Mr. Galvin's...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I didn't do it, Mister.
He's not in, Sir.
Hi, Mickey...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
...Gruber's not bad.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what?
You use their witness.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
The 'History'...?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Dr. Towler...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
The Big Boy did...?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
You seem to know a lot about him.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
How does it happen cars are running?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
What was it like?
They are living creatures out there.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
I don't follow.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
No.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
And...what's the man doing?
When do you think it'll be done?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
You got it.  What's happening?
I want to see the body.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
It can be captured, sometimes.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
Now?
He knows.
Guilty.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Yes sir.
Make us proud.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
You're not a moron.
What was that?
Figured what out?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Is it true Phil?
Yes.
Jesus.
Fine.
I feel like I got you into this.
Who told you that?
My dad.
That's how he died you know.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
You do?
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Suicidal...
Joy, rapture...
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
This be it?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
That's right... Take one of these.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
You hitched yet?
So, it's back to the islands.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
That don't seem fair.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Actin' funny how?
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You mean like pedal pushers?
What kinda trash talk is that?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I do.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
You upset with me?
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
You sick?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
It's okay by me, peanut.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Just tell me what you want.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where?
In the head.
Through the forehead?
Where we goin'?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
He's fine. He's narrating.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He has a book.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Tripp.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
He was never able to reproduce them.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Vernon.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
You're in Kinship?
It's very convincing.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Oh.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
I'm sorry.
No thanks.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Professor Tripp...?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hey.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
You go first.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Is the thing -- is it over?
Not have it.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
Who's he barking at now?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
He's writing his name in water.
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
What is it, Grady?
Do you get high, Sam?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
There's so many...
Five years.
Beautiful. How's business?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
I can't.
I haven't broken any laws.
It's not for sale.
No.
Woodsman?
What?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
And your new apartment?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes?
Does he?
Your daddy will always love you.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
How's that?
I'm still thinking about it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
I don't feel anything.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Do you know what "normal" is?
What did you want to happen?
Is this the first one?
What?
A nap?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
I'm only asking questions.
What?
You never spoke to me before.
Is that a school?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
How young?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
It's a bad idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
What's goin' on, Boss?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
What are you still wearing that for?
What do you think he saw?
What's the scoop, ace?
I think it likes you.
Try again.
How?
We've only got one suit.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Why bring it here?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
He's convulsing!
You better not say you missed that.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Getting a reading?
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Somebody must live here!
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Claudia, listen to me...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Claudia, let's get married?
I don't love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
To do what?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
We have a radio like this, too.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Are you the owner of this place?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Your mother?
You really must do me this one favor.
Through someone else?
Yes.
She'd punish me.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Why?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Of God.
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
I don't know... I don't know...
That wasn't me.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
And you like that?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Would you like to be?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Where do you think babies come from?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
I don't know.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
A mistake...
Not my fault.
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
No...
Her headaches.
No I'm not.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
Why?
I'm afraid.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
And then what happened?
A crucifix.
No.
For me to get sick in.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Who?
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
It was dead.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
... Thank you.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
What man had access to her?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
That's ridiculous...
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
It's possible isn't it?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
???  
Don't deny it!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Where is she?
She didn't want any help.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
No!
The usual ten per cent?
Shurrup!
I'm a deserter.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Ta.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Did you look in here?
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Should I say it?
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Sorry.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
Is it ... is it, really?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
What's that mean?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Pity.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Lip reading.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Give 'em a pull.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Where's my grandfather?
Stop picking on him.
Who?
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Locked.
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Just machinery.
I have recorded the transmission.
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
Yeah!
Where does that go?
Dead.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
How's Broussard?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
No.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
That way.
It's close, real close.
Oh God, oh God no.
It's stopped?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
And what do we do when we find it?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
It's out of focus.
Anything else?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Two down, four to go.
Yeah... I forgot.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kill me...
What can I do?
Headache?  Dehydration?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Shit.  When?
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
Has anybody talked to them?
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Four.
Only six?
Where'd you leave them?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Eddie...
You take charge.
Just some coffee.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
You know me better than that.
What time?
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
Addison...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Didn't you know?
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
You've already met.
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
You're my girl, aren't you?
Many happy returns of the day...
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
It's a good thought.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
That never stopped you before.
So she seems.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I'm trying terribly hard.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Yes, dear.
I just wondered.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
Thanks for your help... good luck.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
- and for you.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Well?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
Don't be dense. The party.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
What for?
I've heard of them.
I might.
Subway.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Try...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Oh, but there is-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
- an understudy's performance.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
What - again?
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
I've got it.
If you'd like.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
You've what?
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
You'll break your neck on that ice.
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
That was a pity...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Yes, sir.
That depends.
Hello..
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--mine's better--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Go on, go on--
You want me to be the bastard.
--we gotta top the Times--
--has he got an ax?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
I'm so glad.
You can't.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Chapin did contact you then?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Speak.
Absolutely--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
FBI too?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
No games, Irwin; give.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Go on.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
Just tell me his title.
--I'm sure--
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...check...?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Where in government?
Are you sure?
It is.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
You can't believe that.
--who you got?--
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
This is your plan, Finch?
Me too.  For the most part.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Neither will I.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
I wasn't making fun of you.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
So we're gonna be close next year?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
What?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Like a bet?
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
You're not...busy?
Okay.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Dad!!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
You guys got the Latin homework?
Who cares?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
What's up, fellas?
So you need to change, right?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
See -- this is the nicest room.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Really?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
They're coming!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
I know where he'll go.
The ADM. Let's go.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Nothing's happening!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Where is it! Please!
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
How to read.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Poor Meetoo!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Dmitri didn't want the money?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
What do you mean?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
I'll show you!
I had nothing to do with it!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
What?
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
Allison.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Yeah, my grammy.
No, I got time.
Okay.
Fifteen years?
M'hm...
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Why not?
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Yeah?
M'hm.
You are extremely sexy.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
That's the key question.
Yeah.
Of course.
You don't want me to live with you?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
yes, we had, uh...
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
Remember that day?
You look very pretty.
You're mad, aren't you?
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh!
This is my room.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Commentary.
Don't get upset!
Where are you going?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Who said that?
Charlie Chaplin.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Ah.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
You like this house, Max?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
So the colored have enough trouble.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
There were many men interested in you?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Very well.
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Had a little help?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
No, what?
What?
What what's about?
Honey?
Why didn't you bring him?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
What is that thing?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Anymore.
Harry called.
Stupid tart.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
I call that a perfect day.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Anytime, sport.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
He's directing now.
Did he promise?
What did you get me?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Two minutes.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Not properly watered.
Well he can't have gone far.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Okay.
I guess.
That's under lock and key.
Panes!  How are you?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Lemon or raspberry?
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn't smoke?
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I don't need a drug.
God willing.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Excuse me?
Sally?
Ryan!
I...
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Will champagne help?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Like the last time.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
I don't want to talk about it.
No.  Not something new.
Panes?
What did I do?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Ah.
Like Joe.
She's such a great photographer.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
And the food sucks, I know.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Why are you doing this?
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Really?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Water...water...
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
You new, kid?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
...Ants...
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Sheldrake?
Oh, I never catch colds.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Really?
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Sure.
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Much better.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
No -- I don't want anything.
In his apartment.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I would.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
You usually eat alone?
What?
I don't?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
Yes, sir.
What kind of joint are you running?
Who?
Are you going to deny it?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Yes, of course.
Well -- I guess so.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
No I didn't.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Help yourself.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
No.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Can I ask you a personal question?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Who?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Handle what?
Coming?
All set for what?
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
Go where?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Dreadful.
What !
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
That's good gin.
Delta ?
What unit were you with ?
None.
Yeah.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Why they call you that?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
... he's an amazing officer.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Well, get in there.
Would he remember you ?
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Charlie?
How did they know?
Yeah.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
But why ?
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
What do you mean?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I met him.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
What?
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
What's a big question?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
30   CONTINUED:
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Where's Corbett?
Leave it here.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Thought that door was open last night...
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
It's Sam Wilder!
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I'm sorry.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Have they done blood tests on him?
No.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Oh, please...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take a bus.
Hello.
Okay to say something now?
What job?
Because...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
But what about...
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Terrify me?
What?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Is there a problem?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
We go around once.
What are you doing?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Where have you been, Robert?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Get on the expressway.
Bullshit.
Forget it!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Why?
How did you get into the business?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
Why not?
Because you are a women.
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Oh.  What do you think about?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Really?
Thank you.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
But he won't shoot you right then?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
That's right.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
What happened?
You didn't take it.
Did he explain how this happened?
Because, I'll take it.
Can I ask you something?
I'm sure you will.
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
Was she the only one?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
I waited another four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
What?
Electra --
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
How much farther?
I hope not.
Right.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Go ahead.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
American currency.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
An alternative literary venue!
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
And put it on expenses?
I thought that was part of the charm!
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Need any disks?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Have you ever stolen anything?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
What?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Yeah, somewhere?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
No!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
No way Doug, I can't.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
No.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Will it help to get you out?
Sure, they are students.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
Will they free me?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
A champion of lost causes huh?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
And the students?
Yeah!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
I think we should be going honey.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
You are responsible...What has happened?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Very well.
And I have no idea why.
What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
To see your father?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Hypotheticals --
You.
Get yourself a glass.
Because I try to be nice to people?
What is that?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for intelligent life?
Yeah.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
You're not in a very good mood.
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
What does that mean?!
Stand right here.
I don't understand...
What would you do up here?
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
From citizen high to citizen low.
Jamie --
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
I'll talk to your father.
Can I -- go out?
By accident --
No.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You're marrying again.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
For pay?
I'd work backstage or something?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Fine..
No, Chinese food is fine.
Well... yeah...
What do I say?
Huh?
Operator...
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Oh, right, right... 
Then where the hell is he?
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Professor? Professor Brown?
Pardon me?
The power converter...
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
There's no way of knowing.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Catch!
Does he bite?
Oh yeah?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
I mean it.
Is that right?
Okay.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
I know.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Somebody else is going to get it.
But it would hurt.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Yeah.
Positive?
It was going too fast.
What?
Yeah.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Fine.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
You didn't walk out here.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
You okay?
Anybody we know?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Was she pretty?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
You keep an eye on it.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Hello, Barton.
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote his scripts for him?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
How d'ya like your room!
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Ever talk to him?
I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
I didn't say anything-
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
I hope these are your shoes.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Well...
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
You gotta believe me –
We gotta call the police –
I'm at the Earle.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
I apologize, Barton.
Congratulations.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Is this multiple choice?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Where were you tonight?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How are you, Nick?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
No.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Because you didn't love him --
I passed.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
There's a name from the past.
Ice?
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
No.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
What did you think?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
No.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
Really.  What are you writing about.
I hate rugrats.
You workin' on another book?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Routine.
He had a girlfriend?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Are you kidding me?
Now what?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Not sure. How was yours?
What do you think?
Of what?
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Cool.
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
I need a dealer.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Paint it out.
Still not here.
SAMO.
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
About what?
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Drugs??!
... I'll buy you some new ones.
What who's saying?
You're back.
It's Monday morning.
You mean babies with you?
Don't you think he's using you?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I really... admire you.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
I don't eat junk food.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
So keep painting.
So shut up and keep painting..
I'll make you another one.
I just don't think you're being fair.
Uh-oh!
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
You're not the Mayor.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Nope, I told her everything.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Son!
Silent night, violent night...
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
I am as well as can be expected.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
How did you...?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
What?
Well...um...her.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
What do you mean?
I think they're getting worse.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
He ran away?
The _Rolls_?
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
What?
...A bat.
How ya doin', Al?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
We all wear masks.
You are direct, aren't you?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
What do you know about obsession?
Excuse me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
...Not the bat?
Excuse me.
Who is it?
How could I forget?
...or death.
How'd you find us?
B-12.
How high up would you say that is?
Which bathroom is that, sir?
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
... How long have I been out?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
As far as I know.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Not what?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
It's the last thing we need.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
It isn't working any more, David.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Here, let me do that.
oh dear.
Oh yes.
It's very good Bernie.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
She's ... well, she's good.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
Yes?
off the peg?
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Nope.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow! These chips suck.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
My butt's bothering me!
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Ah, the witness?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cavity search...?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Do her? Huh huh.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
You'd better sit down, hon.
That's how long you were gone.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Wait for who?
This is <u>my</u> town.
We tried.
Just get some people out of our house.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
No.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Our cemetery?
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
I don't know what that signal means.
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Stepmother's...
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
You don't have a key?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Hellooo!  How's school?
Otho, that's terrible.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Hello, Eve.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
I see.
... Are you sure you like it?
I don't want Robert.
I see.
Ben is very ill.
I certainly do.
Yes, it is very good!
I feel very good in here.
I agree.
Bravo!
Yes, Ben - he is.
Thank you, Ben.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Of men and women.
Please, sir.
I see.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes. That is surprising.
No. I don't object.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
How were you paid?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
You heard?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Yes? What have you found?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Right, Chief.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich.
Morning.
Hi.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
What?
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
You were him last night, weren't you?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Dr. Lester...
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Moving story.
Who told you?
That's the usual?
Yikes.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Lotte, this is so good...
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
How do we do that?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Great then.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
No. Sorry.
You remember Halle.
You don't sit with me!!
I want somethin' sweet.
You on your way home?
May I come in?
Yes ma'am.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
But mama..
She likes this dress...
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't locate him.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Ella.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
Leave off..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Yeah?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
Excuse me?
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
They range up to three thousand.
What--
I was bowling--
It's already posted.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Am I wrong?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
I've had a--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please!  Please!
Lebowski on the right?
I see.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
You mean coitus?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
What's your point, Walter?
So who--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
What the fuck?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
"Our" car, Walter?
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Thanks Walter.
They're nihilists.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is that?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Yeah, and you were--
This driveway.
Uh-huh.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Am I wrong!?
Impressive.
What about Nomak?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Thank you.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
His name is Jared Nomak.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
She's been bitten.
Whistler, I --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
It's dark in here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
You care about him, don't you?
It won't work on you.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I don't believe that.
LaMagra --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Who are you people?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
How?
What, are you alright?
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You said the name "James."
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
Oh, Jesus, no--
The, uh, blur there.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
--which'd be about ten bucks--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
What?
No.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Where?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Yeah. Me too.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
That's a "j."
--turn the camera off--
Okay, but--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Are you alright?
She's off her fucking rocker--
What?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Uh-huh.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
...Ray?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I own the place.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
What's the matter?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
...What?
...Count it if you want.
Don't throw that out.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
. mommy's here.
Look at these. What are these?
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
No. Come on.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Then don't talk about killing.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi. can I come in?
No. I should go.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Dorothy. no!
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
On a ride.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
O.K.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Good to see you, son.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Can I use the car tonight?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
He what?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
No.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Goodness.
What's that?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
No?
Oh my G-d.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Please, continue.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Where do I put this!?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Coke.
Today.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yeah.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
Jesus Christ.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Alright.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
What?
You can call me Dad if you want.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
It's alright, Dad.
But I have a visitor.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Right on.
No shit, Kevin?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Third group.
Don't move, Hacene.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
Then don't complain.
And how many are we?
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Of course I am.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Then how did it get into his body?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Objection, Your Honor.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Sit down, Frank.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Six years.
Tell the court about that, please.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
It didn't.
Why did she say she was leaving?
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Can you give the court an example?
Yes.
No.
Yes -- he did.
What happened?
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Why'd you come here?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?
How'd you meet Marsh?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
You don't need anybody.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Yeah.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Humped
Is that alright, Frank?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Eeeww!
Grateful!?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
What are you doing?
Bar across the street.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Not this kind of heat.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
This time of year.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Want another cigarette?
About a year and a half.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
My mistake. I apologize.
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
How about if I set the table?
How about Bari?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Why do you say that?
STOP IT!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I don't know. Please...
What time is it?
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
When did she decide this?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Is it true?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Where's the others?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Those 'fools' are my people.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Sorry, my brother.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
That place is already bad luck.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Bill!  Bill?!
You got the shit?
What are we doing down here?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
You were just a kid.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Why not?  He eats everything else.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar?  What is this?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Not bad.  What for?
Why?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It couldn't have been.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
The hell I can't!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
You betrayed me!
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Who?
A favor?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
What are you afraid of?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
What choice?
Is that what you think?
Yeah.
Yes.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Where will you be?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Thank you.
How'd it go?
Pop?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I don't know what we're talking about.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
What is Treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
...they won't let you go...
MPG Capital.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Paris?
Did you?
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I want to go home.
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
No.
-- how? --
Stop where you are.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
You have ID?
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
What?
Where am I?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... yer ducts.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
What do I have to do.
Layton.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
What's the matter?
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Yes, thanks.
What is it?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
I'm sure you have
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Tell me about Layton.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
So what are you going to do about her?
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Jack, she's innocent!
You stupid bastard!
How could you do this to me?
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
What's going on here?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Well, terrorists of course.
I was right! Step on it!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Where are you going?
Information Retrieval.
Would you really, Sam?
The refund for Tuttle!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
What?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
This isn't rare!
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
You can trust me on this one.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Is he going to be alright?
The first is always the best.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yes.
I think it looks good.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
The ghosts--
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
She's no whore, Marcus.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
No.
Where's Burke?
Where you going?
Why?
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
He's crazy.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eleven and a half.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I didn't know you were going with him.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
Do others feel that you did well?
Aaron, will you tell me?
This isn't friendship.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Let's go...
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Really?
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Okay.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Do it then.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
No...no.
Oh.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I don't know.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
That actually goes on...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Well, what is it?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
No.  Were you going to you?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's incredible who's here.
Who?
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
Hi.  It's me.
Uh-huh.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
A picnic?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Don't you work here?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
I didn't finish talking to you!
Oh it's enough...
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Is it murdered man?
Where where...
Walter!  Jeez!
I mean, you look so pretty.
Goodbye.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
What?
That's word for word.
Put it in the middle of the room!
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Would you pose for me for free?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I know, man.
Man look at that get up !
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Where'd ya buy that?
I don't have another cat!
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
C-connection?
You are?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Hi.
What do you get?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I was just straightening up the place.
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Invite me in, Pike.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Dying.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
You want some water or something?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Everybody does.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Uh... gym.
Oh.  Sorry.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Fine.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
How can you keep doing this?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
No THX.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Hi, Grueller.
Write that down.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
What are you talking about?
I don't think so.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
I'm yours.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I'd like you to meet my father.
I got lured.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Damn.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
What's so great about baseball?
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Why not?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
We gonna fuck or what?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Will that work for me?
I got him on the knee!
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
I'm trying to thank you.
C ' mon!
No.
No.
Ain't he warning up?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Look at yours.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
I'm serious. No interference.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, you're not calm.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
Now this is just a signature card.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Eight.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Nope, there's no way.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
All right, fine.
All right.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Please...
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Meet me at three.
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Back -
Yeah.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Yeah, she's here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
Sam, we got a problem.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Okay.
Hi. Nice to see you.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
What are you talkin' a- ?
You didn't have to beat him up!
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Oscar wants you to call him.
I should have -
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
But it was just mine.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
When I left here with the money...
Yeah?
Yeah.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Fucker!
Go get a bag, man.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Leave me alone!
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
No problem.
Uh-huh. Good.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Thanks.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
Come on. Don't be scared.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
What about my money?
Thank you. Very nice.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Yeah.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Mm-hm.
Why?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
They'll do it.
Whoa. Calm down.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Tony.
How you doin'?
Yeah.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Works for me.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Are you sure?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
God, can you hear me!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Even the skylight?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Car wash, Captain?
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
For when the time comes..
Enough.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
You turned around!
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Okay, deal.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
You could've killed us.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Got your badge?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Nels?
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Oh won't I?
What do they need her for?
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
What are you doing now?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
Sometimes I paint.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
What's happening?
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Yes sir.
Why can't it be her?
It's locked.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
What's happening?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Took preparation.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
You're making it too easy.
They saw you kill the driver.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Stay there.
It's your call.
And then?
What's he doing?  Answer me!
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
Yeah?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
How far off are you?
We're gonna get there first.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
See what, Dil?
Saw it, Dil.
Did I?
Take your clothes.
Fuck off, Dave.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What?
In a way.
You know.
You on the game?
No, I didn't --
Give me that look again.
Jesus Christ!
Must be in love to manage that.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
Why?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Give it over, Dil --
Shut up.
That's a start.
Ask to meet me again.
Absolutely.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
What?
Kind of.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Don't call me that --
You heard what I said, Dil?
What?
You tried.
Never.
Meet Col --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to lose myself awhile.
He's hot.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Eddie and Tinker died.
No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
You may be right.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Just a girl.
Right.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
What makes you think that?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
She your wife?
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Yeah?
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Rock.
We don't look on it like that.
I didn't.
She can't help it.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
You won't run.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
What are you talking about?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
Adam --
What is it?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Thanks very much.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Who?
Café.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Very good.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Bartholomew?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Very pretty. Now what?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Would you like to see my passport?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Which one are you?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
What day is it?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
What -- like Scobie?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
And if it is?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Leave me alone -- !
Swiss.
But he is gone.
Quitter.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Please, not on my account.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Charles is.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
I don't know where to go.
What was all that?
En garde.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What was what?
Where?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Good night.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Words can hurt very much.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Who is it from?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
Why?
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I want you to head right home after school.
I'm not.
No!
You know where I can find her?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Yes.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Sharon's far from a slut.
You didn't believe her?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
Two men left town right after it happened.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Maybe it won't stay in.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
 Oh...

Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Where's Sam?
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Huh?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Go on.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
You stole this truck!
Hey.

Okay.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...you.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...we can make it.
Goddamn!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.

...ho!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
All right.
...you're dealin' with!
He's crazy!
Taking it down the hill.
Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.

Uh-oh.
Okay.
...-tion?
So you took his...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
...hospital.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...deal with this asshole.


Arlo!  Arlo.
 Come on!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
  I've got the real thing!
Okay...
 What's it say? 
We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Look out.
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
You did help a little.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Oh!
Yeah.

 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...



You-You can't let him...
What?  Say again...
We've got it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
No!
You'll kill us all!
No, go--
...that.
"Went away."  I like that.
And let me guess.  You failed.
...happen if I drop this?
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...


And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
That's right.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...noon.
It's a hundred degrees...
....-lene.
...never done a thing for you?
You try anything, it goes in...
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
It's not over, Brynner.
What's going on, colonel?
That little geek is my...
...son.

...-time. 
He's brains without ambition...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Where are you now...
...tunnel!
You find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...stole a truck under arrest.
Get in 


Arlo.
Oh.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
Very.
Maybe.
How did you find out?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
What does this mean?
Haven't the faintest idea.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
What's that, Curly?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
You sure this is okay?
That's a filthy habit.
Yes.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
You've done well by yourself.
Since when?
Didn't you call?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Unless what?
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
K... Cross.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Then it was over the water department.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
We got it. We got it, baby.
Is that unusual?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
Where are you going?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You saw my fa... father? When?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
It's possible.
Yes.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Where'd he go yesterday?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
You'll find one of those people.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Have we ever met?
Gittes?... Gittes?
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Yes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
You don't say?
What are you doing here?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
No...
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Will they really find work in Germany?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
For what?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Then where's the money?
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
There is no news big enough.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
Hello, Brad -
Almost two to one -
I intend to find out.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
I didn't say.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Poor Mr. Carter!
Yes?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
What do you mean by that?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I've got to think of Emily -
Brad, you are drunk.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I know you will.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Yes.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
How did you meet him?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
Are you serious?
That's it, everybody out.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
So where is he?
There's no light back there.
You're kidding.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Just now.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Sang.
He's not invited.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
We did.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Excuse me?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
What do you mean?
Your mother.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Return of the Jedi.
Yeah.
And the second time around...?
Each egg has to be perfect.
Nudie booth?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
At least we're stuck here together.
Pull my laces tighter.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Exactly. They drank it all.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
An embarrassing way to die.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Balls resting on his lips.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Really?
You're lying.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
I'm happy.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, what about Veronica?
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Oh, like your life's any better?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Do you work tomorrow?
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I don't think so.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
It's not my store.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Hunhh? Nothing.
I was kidding.
Three.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
What time do you get finished?
What the fuck did you do that for?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Would you let me explain...
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
You said you were here all day?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
I think the lady called it.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You'll be missed.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
What?
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Where are you, Walker?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
What the hell are you doing here?!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
I'm going with you.
Do you see them yet?
Hello, Gabriel.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Did I miss something?
What if he can't?
No luck?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Don't let me fall!
Thanks for holding on.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Just kidding.
No, he's gone.
Where's the rest of the team?
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
No names, this is an open line!
What did you do that for?
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Won't you join me, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
I beg your pardon?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
No, sir, I feel really great.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
C of E, sir.
Are you an Epileptic?
Crabs?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Are you referring to the background score?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
I've done my best, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Four in this block, sir.
Shall we go to my office?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You psychic?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
But not now?
When was the last time you took one?
How often you go?
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Oh, my, yes.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd had to dig it.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
What kind of question?
Can't say that I do.
Federal?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What's he sayin'?
Yo, whassup?
...oh God, don't shoot me...
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
We have a deal.  What's your name?
Max.
You always stutter?
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
No.  You say you're cool.
Tonight it is.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Please.  Don't do anything.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
Max?  What are you doing?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
As in...? 
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Who?
Any special reason?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I don't see the connection.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Not for years.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
As opposed to?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
So why are they after you?
You want something to drink?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
So what's the question?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Okay, I will.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
What is it?
Back where?
Liza?
What's that?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Working.
Yes.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
Tell me about it.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Yes, sir.
Hope there's a cartoon.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
Right.  Well.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Can't we get rid of them?
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Could we hear to the moon?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
That isn't the way it works.
It's time to go home now.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I didn't realize I was out.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
The V.L.A.?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
But what about your research -- ?
Ellie --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And mind, yes.  What are you --
I flinched.
Do you love your parents?
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
How do you mean?
I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
But --
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Gotta have kings.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Lemme see it!
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you mean, Luke?
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
One, two, three... 
I want to die.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
He was lying.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You get me out first.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
You already made the delivery?
What Friday?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where is it?
The door was already open...
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
You know where.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Is he out?
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
That's no surprise.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Yessir.
Oh, maaaaan?!
So what have we got?
What the hell you need her for?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It's about time.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
You haven't told me where we're going.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Please finish your story.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
And the party?
What do you think of this one?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What's his name, Letty?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What if it's got a pattern?
A while, I guess.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Wow.
Sounds grim.
I guess so.
Well then why'd it happen?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
So, another one bites the dust.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
I'm going to the store.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Are you all right?
No.
I love him.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Oui.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Uh, no --
But you were there?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
For what?
What kind of business?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I thought they came with batteries.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
Good idea.
All right, knock it off.
Anybody hungry?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah?
It's me.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
What'd you guys find?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
What room number?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
What is it you do, Sami?
How?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
The money isn't here.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
It's for you.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Yes.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Why do you want to teach me?
You don't seem to understand.
This spells trouble.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You're doing calligraphy?
Please.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's stop a moment.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I will.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Then, why did you come?
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Shu Lien...
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You're welcome.
Mom --?
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Fun -- look at that guy...
Do you feel okay.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
What's goin' on, Elly?
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Shut up.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
...necklace... pearls...
What... the hell is that?
No shooting.
Who got himself what?
"Our" Crow...?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
I'm Kathryn.
Forever.
You did?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
It's not really important.
You talking to me?
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
How was your date?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Why are you doing this?
I just came to say goodbye.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm sorry about that.
What do you mean?
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
That was cool.
Well do you like him?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Why didn't you do something?
No.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Just taking your photo.
But -
Need any company?
Good night Cecile.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Who is this?
I told you I don't know.
Hello.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I don't find this very funny,
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Care to make a wager on that?
Fuck her yet?
What's wrong with you?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Any day now.
Morning.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Kind of.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Hi. Is Annette at home?
What do you want?
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Right after we played backgammon.
What time is it?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Irena.
It's early yet.
Did you hear the child out?
That's the Farren house.
I got lots of presents.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
No.
I'm your friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
But we don't have any sea weed.
Your children?
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
You?
But why?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
What is it, ma'am?
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
What?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Only to see.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
No, did you fuck him?
No. I don't think so.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
What the hell is the tampon test?
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
What happened to his tooth?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
No. I won't let you do that.
Frida? You okay?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Coffee and...
Did you change your hair?
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
When's the last time you saw him?
You busted me.
Are you following me?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Briefs.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No, I got it. It's okay.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Peter I love you too but...
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Here's a towel.
You want her sheets?
He was found a few blocks away.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Dammit!
How can I submit this?
Why give yourself up?
People...  after me.
Then we must call the police.
Donít kill me!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
What does she say?  The woman.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
How much do you usually get paid?
A month.
Alan
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Die, you pond scum!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Clean.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
So you want to go swimming?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Extend things?
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Will he be alright?
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Presence.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
And it's proving quite effective...
Perceptual?
Why?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
What about it?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
That's a secret.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah.   He's a good man.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Help me get him to the boat.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Tonight?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
What?
Ain't no place safe.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Yeah.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Yes... sir.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
You fucked up little prick!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
I didn't know you taught.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Again!  Louder!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
I'll take him over mine.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
They are...they are everywhere.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
I saved your life is what I did!
Noooo!
Self sufficient...
I don't know where it is!
Like cattle...
What?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
What did you do the my kids!!
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Fucking women, man...
Damn right!
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
John,we're going huntin'.
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Where? Where is he?
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
No, I --
No. None of that.
I came to see Merle.
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sal.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda, Linda...!
How are you?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
I don't know.
I'm just so lonely.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
What'd he say?
Is he from here?
Merle --
I thought you might be praying.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
We what?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Great. That's great.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Listen, Nick --
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
No.
What the hell's that for?
No.
Never one.
You're full of shit!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I'm wasting time.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Fine.
Does it drive itself, too?
They're going to rob that bank.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Hey, I'm eating.
How do I look?
...Have you been drinking?
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
You know that you're in my house.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
What do you want?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Belle.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
But what becomes of our souls?
It's mine?
Look here now--
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Headache -- Squire?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Jabez!
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
You'll never change -- will you?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Jabez -- Jabez!
Consarn the consarn --
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Ma -- is she? --
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
'Roy'.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Bullshit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Yes, I would.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
Yeah...
I'm sorry...
Well...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
That's it.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
What am I supposed to do?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
You don't have a choice?
Yeah... yeah.
It's my only chance!
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
How many you got in there?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
The girl hostages.
What the fuck do you want?
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Don't fuck with me ...
The gun's right on your back...
What if I take you with me?
I'll be God damned if you will.
Sure - we like you.
We like you, too.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
It was on the TV.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...

What?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Hey, let's get ready!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Did Pop come down?
Why are you doing this?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
You could give up.
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>I forgot.</i>
Where are we going?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
What?
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Cool it, Choco.
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
I be.  I'm living large.
I don't like anything else.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I'm gonna leave now.
And?
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
You the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
No!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Stop tripping.
Innocent!
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
How are you holding up in this weather?
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Don't worry about it.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Where are you going?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Just coolin'.
What?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Keep dreaming.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Ya like him, huh?
Whaddup.  Money?
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
But I came here to learn about America.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Yeah. How'd you know?
Hey guys.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Home school? What's that?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
You're not my real dad.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Can he do that?
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Who's your partner?
You're always your harshest critic.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Me, me, me!
A blimp.
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You're it.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Wait, wait!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
That's gross.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
You're just jealous.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
So could you get us into the principal's office?
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Can you believe it?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Will that be on the midterm?
Obviously.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Left here! Left!
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
Is this what you seek?
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Would you really have drawn my blood?
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
The Water of Life.
Long live the fighters!
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Where?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
No.  I don't work here.
Thank you.
I never thought of that.
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Are you sure this is okay?
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Dracula?
Bela, what happened?!
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Don't let me slow you down.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
And, cut...
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
I've never seen anything like him!
Um, okay... roll camera
Rolling.
Isn't he?
What?
No!  A horror movie star!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
I told you this was gonna happen.
I'm going to my mother's.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
For this one, we need $60,000.
What other sixty-thousand?
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hruphh...?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
There's still a sex-change --
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Oh.  Congratulations.
I am.  How's your father?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Well you tried --
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Uh, atomic energy?
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Huh?!
I'm really sorry...
You're sure this is gonna work?
You know, to make the legs move --
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Yes!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
You know what would be great?
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Great line.
I don't think so.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Really? They were..
No.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
I mean, that worked out.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Right, yeah --
Hi. Is Shari here?
What is she, at work?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
I mean bad.
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
So?
I'm sorry.
Where?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Kinda'.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
I got your message. Way to go!
Screw off.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Marcia's living with a singer?
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I was in jail.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
We have to stop meeting like this.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Ohhh...
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Yeah, just --
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
What?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You're kidding, right?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Sure
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
I also like bananas.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
What?
What?
People can see this.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Don't you fucking knock?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
I don't know.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business, Captain?
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
What's through here?
Where are we going?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Let's just kill them.
You expecting problems?
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
Against your code?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
I don't have time.  I have --
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
<u>No</u>.
You're the key witness?
Glasses.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
You make a mistake?
So what's the point?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Lynn Bracken.
Not good enough.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It seems like my Susan, but...
A sweet man.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What's he doing here, Sid?
And Reynolds?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
What's wrong, Trash?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Um...who's that?
Listen--
It is?
A direct one.
I'll pay you.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
They come after you?
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Where?
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Pretty fast.
What are you dialing?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Why?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
About the accident.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Because I don't know.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know, but listen--
I know.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Good.
That's okay.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
He doesn't work that way.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
Why?
You being audited?
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
What makes you think it's you?
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Bobby--
Mr. Dean--
What are you talking--
Why?
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Where've you been?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
How long can you stay?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Turn yourself in.
Bobby--
I need help.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What about the tape?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Yes?
Excuse me?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
You felt obliged to.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I'm impressed you can sew.
You don't sew at all!
When were you most happy?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
No.
It's so cold.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
If I could just see some identification.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
How are you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Don't cut me.
Yeah, for a while.
No.
Ask him.
Where did you find that?
Well, then ask him his name!
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Have a drink.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
You'd better be.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Mac's signature.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Mr. MacDougal.
You have a car?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
We going somewhere?
Very nice.
Give him the card.
He says they turned the card down.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
We're going to die, aren't we...
I don't believe this.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
Only a week?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
I'll need that.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
What?
We're living history here.
The sign of our partnership.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Jesus God, it's going through.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
There's more than one?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
How does someone get meningitis?
Cause of the chromium.
What's chromium?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Yup.
Yeah?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
I like this case.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Whoa.  No shit.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Erin, it's just a meeting.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Ten?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
What are you doing here?
Great.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
It was .... the Emperor ....
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
You must survive, Luke.
And that is why I must go.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
... the power?
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Not you?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Now you're making sense.
That was no earthquake.
No lightspeed?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Who's staring?
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Thanks to you.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Repairs ...
How's your mining operation going?
You're part of the mining guild then?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
Zira, are you mad?
With food?
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
I tried...
Give it.
Oh Cuervo...
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
What's the little black box do?
Having second thoughts?
Get this crap out of me.
Lock fuel rods.
Where is it?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Later.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Where's the anti-toxin...?
I'm looking for somebody.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Arthur.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Yes.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Because you and the land are one.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
It's-
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Yes, I go now.
She is going to be well?
Morning.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Chris MacNeil?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Yes am.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Have you told him what's happening?
Yes. He's already here.
What did you do today?
Oh look at that.
Where?
You really don't want me to play huh?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Well I heard differently.
How do you know?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
I'm not Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
No now.
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Okay
No.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Amen.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Miss?
Yes?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Your pay.
So?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
What's wrong with them?
They're falling out.
How's the birthday girl?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh my God ...
Oh no!
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
You're their uncle.
You gotta go.
What do you mean?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
It wasn't like that.
No?
Sure, why not.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
What's the matter?
I'll drop the eighths.
Awe inspiring.
Just a lucky guess.
Last?
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Right.
You leaving that on?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
She's a big girl.
What?
You saw wrong.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What do you mean?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Go ahead.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Yeah?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Sick?  How sick?
Blanche.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Where's your dress?
What's he talking about?
Come on.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
He's right.
You're kidding me.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
What?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Brought it.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
He doesn't bite.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Save it.  What's he look like?
You never sang before?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Forget it.
Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
I can keep the beat.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
You were good.
Must've been a cheap date.
Huh?
Coffee?
Huh?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Losing his teeth.
The recent past.
Older than me.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Hey, bro ...
A few blanks?  Like what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
We need to talk.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Not anymore.
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Clarissa left those here.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Oh, that Karl.
Nothing.
I'm going to the powder room.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Take you, for instance...
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Jack, are you okay?
Excuse me?
We’re almost done here...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
On a case by case basis...
Got it.  Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Is it...?
Trouble at work?
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Pretty much.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
No.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Me?
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Like the dress...?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Uh huh...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Don’t  go, Jack...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Jack...don’t even start...
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
...my feet are hurtin’...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Really.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Then say it...just say it to me...!
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
That’s a big one for me, too.
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Don’t do that...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Do I know you?
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Damn...damn...damn...
Of course I did.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
He's made a few changes.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The less time, the better.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What is it?
And take a little trip with them...
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes, Alan.
Listen...the Heart.
We must!
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That's what they pay me for.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Where we going?
May I?
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Any reserve air?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Then don't drift down further.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Clear him off the road.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Yah, he -
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
I unnerstand.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
but do you know that for sure without -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Where're you going?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
...Dad?
Twice.
Okay.
...Is everything okay?
lot. It's a limited -
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Hiya, Lou.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...This is a nice place.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Anyone else residing there?
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Linda Cooksey?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Thanks, hon.
Oh, fine.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
He's at Norstar.
Cornelius!  How are you?
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Is that your blood?
Hmm?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
No, I wasn't aware...
Sure.
And I saw you practicing this...
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
You're kidding.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Really?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
... A person.
Guy or girl?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Marla...
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Tyler...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Do what you like.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
How do you feel?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
I know that.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Hum.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Okay.
Homework assignment.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
I don't know!  Nothing!
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
You're too young.  Sorry.
Why do people think I'm you?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Fuck you.
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Why what?
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
What?
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
There is no money.
Ain't that something?
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah, how?
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
Signs?
Another premonition?
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Yeah?
Whoa, nine months?
Stop it, don't move him!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Sure.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
What feeling?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
I'm... really sorry.
"It?"
Is that something you're "feeling?"
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Stop the car!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
And don't pass on the right.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
Get control of yourself!
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
That's what I'm here for.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
We'll check it out.
American?
Roundeye.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
Why's that?
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Intelligence work.
Thanks.
I know.  I go with you.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
What's the job?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Christ almighty.
About 22 hours on site.
You think they'll find any?
I know.
Take your time.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Am I out of here?
This your stuff?
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Fine.  I'll say no.
Huh-huh.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Oh, Lydia!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Who?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Holdin' my penis...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
I don't like horror movies!
You don't have to say that.
A wig?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
You can sing the song.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
You're depressed that I come along.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
How far are you going to?
Where are you going?
No substitutions.
No. We have tomatoes.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I don't make the rules.
Robert Eroica...
Yeah... I guess so...
What questions?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
You were going without saying goodbye?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's dangerous, you know.
Wait...
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Catherine...
What?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What kind of doggy is that?
And what about love?
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Fine.
What?
I, umm, came to see you.
Eddie from Compost?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
They are?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Which one?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You looking for somebody?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Yeah.
Nineteen.
Mrs. Smith.
Funny old bird.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
I'm serious, Sam.
I'm fine.
Can I get you something?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
Good evening.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Then he has.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
John Ultramalensky, right?
That's Brazil.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Who?
Why don't you try suicide?
I'm still here.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
John Ultrarelamensky.
So were my parents.
I have this effect on lots of women.
Alan's in Utah.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
But I've seen the deed.
No.
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
You can't do that.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
One.
I would, actually.
So you're saying she moved out.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Get out of here.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
So many assholes, so few bullets.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're saying you need money.
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
How'd you get this from her?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Yeah, let's bury her.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Three hundred.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
It's red, Ford.
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
It's me.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's funny, you're cute.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
So...
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
What's your story?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Give who a tail?
Suspicion of what?
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
You're shitting me!
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
How was your tour?
Wish you weren't.
Okay...
Frank, we need to talk...
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear, Satch.
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Where are you transmitting from?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Dad...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
When?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Are you alright"?
What?  What is it?
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Which means he probably knew her.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
He ain't our guy, John.
I try to be.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Who are you?
Hell-
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
What're you gonna do?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
Do you want a beer or not?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What happened that night?
What d'ya got in there?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
What?
No.
Did you hear me?!
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Why didn't you cremate him?!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
I'm here.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Steven buggin' you?
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should be moving on.
It was a community service.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
What's wrong?
What murders?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Dear Christ...
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
What a beautiful day.
You're telling a lie.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
You pushed me...
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Really?
But I didn't get you one...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Crosstown.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Do we care?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
He'll hate it.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Great game.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'll have whatever she's having.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
All the failures, all the fatalism.
I'm at the door.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
We must have been heroic.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Because life is good.
Then they lost?
'm not worried about this kid.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
And the Father replies?
What's good?
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Home.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
No violence, please.
A -- a week.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
It was one incident.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You're an ambitious man.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm.  Is it?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Who's leading them?
Who are you trying to convince?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
What are you waiting for?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
How often do you test, Director?
Hello.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
What's wrong with it?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
It needs work.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
If you say so.  The stripe.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
How was your evening?
Where are we going?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Why not?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Yes.
Have they found our friend?
Friend?
What happened?
What is it?
I can't do this.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
I get my own help.
You want to drive?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
Just like old times?
Wait... give me a minute.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Really?
I couldn't have... much longer.
That doesn't hurt.
At least you were outside.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I don't want to go there.
You sent me to him.
And switched keys.
I can handle it.
When we had trouble before it was different.
What do you want to do?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
I'll be ready.
What now?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
And I keep my mouth shut?
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
I got a nurse in mind.
You knew what I'd do.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
Why?
Good evening.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
I work for him.
Sid Fletcher.
Yes.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Nasty.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Not entirely. No.
Wilton Estate.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
I see.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
My brother, Frank.
I'm sorry.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What about Keith?
What's that supposed to mean?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Nasty way to go.
Not going, Jack?
I have to. Things to see to.
What's that?
I'm not?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
What?
What?
As a robbery.
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
You're saying "me."
I...
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Why?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
...what am I going to do all month...
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
I don't know, George, why?
That they're going to be upset.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me, fella.
...did they...
Who told you...?
Aaronow...
Levene!
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...after the thirtieth...
...you talk to Murray...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
What happened?
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What does that fucking mean?
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Mmm.
How do you know I made it up?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
Only the beginning...
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Fuck you care...?
What is it?
Glad to meet you.
Yes.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
The monthly interview...?
Rick...
Gimlet.
Who did she call?
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
You don't count Saturday.
When did you write the check?
She told me I have to.
She told me not to talk to you.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck you.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
...you want to go out today...?
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Three.
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I don't want to stay here...
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
What is it?  Can I help?
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
You're going to talk to him now.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
The room has a bug in it.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Do you owe markers?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Yes.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I had no idea...
Where?
On a plane back to Sicily.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Let him gamble.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
We got friends in the commission.
Yes.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
This looks corny.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course.  I am married still.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
What do I do?
Or would you prefer a beer?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
I don't like to talk about that.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No.  I could have, though.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Can I see what you did so far?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Do you miss it?
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
What was that about?
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Let's get out of this funk hole
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You are much too human.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Fuck off!
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
She is horrible.
Does the yardman come today?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Can that count as one question?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Six years ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
It seems she neglected to mention it
Who was the job for?
Fish.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You want to come along quiet?
How's that?
I know you.
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Consider me gone, Detective --
What's this -- ?
Got it ...
C'mon, man ...
Donny --
You guys have any skills at all?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
What does that mean -- ?
No.
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Hey, Kip ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
No worries ...
She does have one thing you don't.
What's that?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So what's in there -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
I warned you a million times.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
What do you do?
The bag with the envelopes.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What did he say, exactly?
You what?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Jimmy.
It's a fait accompli?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He's with his friends.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
What do we got?
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
When's the arraignment?
Thanks, Chuck.
How's the woman?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
No, I had to talk him down.
Is this a bad time?
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What class did you say that was?
How'd you like that course?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
No, there's a limit.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
What's that?
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
I don't know what it's called.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Find out what?
Good to see you.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
I'll be okay.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Oh, that's nice--
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Where're you going?
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
That's very presumptuous.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
285.
Yeah. Do you paint?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
No.
No.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I don't know.
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
They could see that I meant it.
Do you think you're alone?
What?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
You want to read it?
Yes.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
See ya.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Five minutes.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Oh, you will?
Well...
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
How do you know that?
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Yeah.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Don't hold me so tight.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
So long.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Crate fell on me.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Been out travelin' around?
No, I never. What?
Excuse me for asking.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
She's settlin'.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
What's the matter?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Naw--not much!
You been acrost?
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
But will it--hurt the baby?
I like the tent better.
How 'bout it?
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Sometimes they do.
Yes'm, that was it.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
I ain't full.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Then what, Tom?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
You can have this for ten cents.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
What's this?
Now you done it! You busted it!
We can pick anything.
You do not.
You're so funny...
What do you want to do?
How long has it been?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Are you going to the reunion?
Well, there's not much to tell.
Watched television?
As long as I get the laugh.
Do you want to get a drink first?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Get the fuck outta here.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
You went to school with these people.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Throw that away.
All of it?
That's going to cost.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Don't forget your identity.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Yeah...
Paul?
What the hell happened to you?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Does Chicago count?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
The answer's no.
How did you meet her?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Show me again.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Yeah, you know everything!!
Started what?
What?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Who's there?
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I should go get some of her things.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
I love you.
What was I saying?
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Why?!
She will if you think she should.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
I don't understa-
Was the trip okay?
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Don't you go to school?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
I know. Amazing.
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
You're looking fit.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
What?
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Did you talk to him?
Dead?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Blow me.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Crash Override.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yeah.
Uh, hold on...
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
I'll make it up to you!
Never fear. I is here.
Die, dickweeds!
Joey, Joey...
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Virus?
What the hell was that all about?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
When did you find this out?
This morning.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
What does that mean?
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Because the lights are all out.
Has he been prepped?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Watch it.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Do you love me Rachel?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
It was the nightmare man
Come on Rachel!
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Rachel come on.
What are you doing out here alone?
Why?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
You got your riot gun?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Where's that Deputy?
Where's the radio?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Hello?
Annie, was that you?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Thanks.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
You locked yourself in.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't know.
I don't want to.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Fantastic. Totally.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Ten minutes.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Well, she's totally not here.
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I don't like that story.
There WAS.
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
I promise.
There's nothing else I can do.
What did you use before?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
We're a big hit.
Right.
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
I can't resist.
You're Holly.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Well, are...are they big?
Yeah.
Yeah.  How are you?
Oh.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I almost didn't.
Lee... uh...
This is not an easy situation.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Aren't they great?
You bet.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I want one with you.
Are you angry with me?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mm-hm.
Elliot lusts after you.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Why?
Because I have to!
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
Oh...
Oh, Jesus!
Hello?
So how are you?
How are you?
How is everything?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Go right over there.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, he's such a loser!
Here.  Be careful with those.
Singing?
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Hmm!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I'd never do that.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh.  Oh.
You're okay, though, huh?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Oh, well.
Really?
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh!
Oh, yeah?  What?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Hi.
I'm going to tell you later....
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
...you...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
I'm looking for...
You want me to be?
What, What, I can't hear you...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
Yeah, so where is he?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...sir...?
He don't like popcorn.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
I won't take much of his time.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
..suitcase...locker...
Why?
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I said sometime it gets so...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
...how so?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
How could you know?
Darling...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Ask me when we get home.
Hello....?
What shape is the scar?
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
She must be something special After Dark.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then what brings you back?
...no...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
...yes...?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
You think you're so...but you're just...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Man, she's losing it...
Mine!
No, they're not from Wendy.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Iunno.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Because you're an idiot.
Because you're an idiot.
I was talking with someone!
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Heather? Wha...
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don't know. Should you?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
And your worst enemy.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Answer him dick!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
 Got an A, Mum!
Who cares!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
That's coming along well!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
This.
John has fallen in love with me!
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Well?
Sorry.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Must be nice.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
But... I thought...
In a word? Lucrative.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Hey buddy!
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Are you ready?
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Spanish kinda guys!
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I snuck in.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
What picture?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What is it?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
How'd it go?
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
Was that your dad?
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm looking for some perfume.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Oh, great.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Do you have a family?
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Why are you mad at each other?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
That's not the case.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
What for, dickweed?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Would you?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
They appear to be authentic.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
What?
Where were you last night around nine?
Yes -- I think it is.
You?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
I hear you.
The river.
Thank you, Thomas.
I'll go first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I would like to say goodbye.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Aye.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Why do you stare at me like that?
About what?
No.
Yes.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Would you like to see it?
Where will you go now?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
My dreams died long ago.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
You think we should take that chance?
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Okay.
Who else is here?
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Where are they?
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Go, Chief.
Chief, base.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Sounds like you know the job.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Chief, Mikkelson.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
I think so.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Who is it?
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Excuse me?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
And four children?
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What do you mean, General?
No, sir.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
You think they will believe you?
Very good.
You have no whiskey?
When will they be here?
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Thomas wants advice?
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What about us?
Go out! Where?
I have a confession. When we met...
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What does it matter.
Please, please try one more time.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Paul. Are you alright?
I don't know.
I'm confused.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- bullshit --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Oh, for chrissake --
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Three times, to be exact.
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
This thing's going nowhere.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What is it? What's in there?
What's down there?
Oh. Jesus.
Pritchett, is that you?
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Prove it.
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Price!!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
I was in the middle of --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
I think...I may have the answer.
What is it??
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
-- the window and door grates --
Fascinated.
-- confirming everything we already know --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Blackburn's dead.
For the love of God....please...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
They don't build them like this anymore.
It looks delicious...
A few years older, perhaps.
Good-bye.
Can you talk to her?
We're going to go someplace new.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
It's just going to take a while.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
So what are you saying?
Aubrey!
Should I...
We're not going.
Are you all right?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Thank you.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
And what would you do?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Where did you find this?
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Hello?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
And he still sits there?
Every day.
But I don't know what's going on.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Can we see?
You're JP Monroe, right?
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
You're apologizing?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Did I miss anything?
But I said I was sorry....
Why not just go now?
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
My life is not some deal.  I...
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
I hope you know what....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Snappy.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, maybe I --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Sid found me the icepack.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
You know, on farm route 17.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
I can't print this!
How long've you been down here?
This I know, Benny.
Wuddya mean, buddy?
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Geez, I --
Sir?
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...This'll only take a moment.
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
But, sir! --
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
...Enter the dame.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
I think you need some help.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
But you didn't have to come up here.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
-- But, you're an American?
Mr. Holland?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
No, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I heard you playing.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
Well?
I wanted to help you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
I... I think I am...
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Dinner in ten minutes.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
What's for dessert?
If you're going to insult me --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Yeah.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Educated guess.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
You ask what the point is?
Arise and shine, young Hood.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Truly? Do speak.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Where you going?
Wow!
Watching what?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Can I come?
Is this Charles?
Hey Sandy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
One more shot?
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Duggar called him?
Not really.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
I know.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
How do you mean?
Randy Stetz?
What do you want to talk about?
That's not what he thinks.
One of your cases?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
She used some stupid code name.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Yes.  Like that.
Where's your back-up?
Your lips, they didn't move.
I was waiting for you...
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
I want more.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
You know her?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
What danger?
So you felt it too!
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Paris? You came from Paris?
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
We belong in hell.
The girl, Lestat -
She's here, your wounded one.
Lestat!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
And they frighten you?
Can a vampire feel love?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
No...
Yes...
And the child who did die?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Oh!
Yes.
You get any sleep at all?
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
Be careful, Julie.
Can't what?
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Checking the locks again?
Don't kill me --
You sure?
I'm sorry.
It was one year ago...
Julie? What's wrong?
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
...Why?
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
How much?
He leave you?
What's going on?
Drunk again?
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
Goodbye.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
What an odd question!
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Stand back.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
What?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Yes, George?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
George Bailey.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Thank you very much.
Well, sure I do.
Hi, Daddy.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Yes, sir.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Huh?
No, George, don't . . .
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Me?
Too young or too old?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
In that place?
I'll take it. And then what?
Do you like it?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Is it snowing?
Mary! Mary!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
What plates?
Huh?
You can?
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
Loser sails home alone.
I thought you said she was going with us?
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Tina!
Chief....
I never heard of a 908.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
I'm going.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Mike?  Is that you?
Dad, I'm sorry....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What else you got?
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Okay, so that's it.
What makes you think there might be?
Can't you tell?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Fooling around?
Let's get the kid home.
Hey!  That's my boss!
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
I know what you're going to say.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Are you serious?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Hi Dad.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
No class.
What's that mean?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Hurry, please.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
What's the lighthouse?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
Who wouldn't.
Maybe.
No.
We're ready for you.
It hasn't adjusted.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Sure am.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Oh, yeah.  Very.
What's wrong?
Up.
How the hell did it get in here?
I know I can capture it.
Here.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Recovering nicely.
Yes, you can.
So?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Why are you?
Philip.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Musclehead?
Hi, Mike.
I don't know, it depends.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
The one that goes underwater?
Let's go, let's go!
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Make sure you put this back.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
It's not closing, Mike.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Who's grown up?
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
No....
Where is she?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Whatever happens next.....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
That hurt....
Don't be late.
I like Grandma's cooking....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
It's late....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Why'd you come out here?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Can you just go off...?
Sure you can....
A big one....
Grab your socks....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Come on, Hoagie....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Feathers all over the place....
Will you leave me alone...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
Put me down....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
When we got the grant....
What?
How come only me?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Shit....
I'll do it, Jake.
Jake.
Oh, Jake... 
When he has a pillow over his head....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
What do you think?
What does that mean?
What time is it?
Maybe?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Listen to me saying what?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
You ain't going in alone?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
And did they?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Vehicle references.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Yes.
How d'you know what I'm like?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I don't want them to arrest you.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
What does that mean?
You think he still loves her?
She married some English prick.
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
No one has ever dumped me.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
... light.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
We are?
Truth?
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
What --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
It's my fault.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
I heard.
Thank you.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I'm sorry, I --
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I don't want to be friends anymore.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Cronin's okay for lunch?
You...
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
-- and I'll get 'em.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
What?
You look good.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
It's not safe.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
What did you think?
We need to head for the coast.
Are you sure?
Amanda!
Sorry.  We were saying?
Is there an antidote?
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
What?
I'm not going, John.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
What are you guys gonna do?
Okay.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You version of it.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Are you insane?!
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
-- way we could safely --
You've got to be kidding.
What now?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
So what are you thinking?
The fences are electrified, right?
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
C'mon on, this way.
I get ah - -
And scary.
Alan?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Are they heavy?
I read your book.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You have no idea.
The kids okay?
I know.
We gotta do something.
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Dad - - Dad - -
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I'm a hacker!
That's not funny.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
You want to put in chain saws?
I think we're lost.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Who's chest?
Well?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
So?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
What are you doing?
What happened? Where's Jason?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Just what you've published.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
An empty tomb?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Well, I --
I do.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
They're not obliged to tell.
You don't believe that.
No -- not this time.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
It usually is.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Yeah.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Why? She's a junkie.
Enjoy.  Well --
Do you always have to repeat?
Yes indeed.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
What about?
Could I ask some questions?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
-- OK --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
What do you think?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
What're you gonna do next?
It's kind of late.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Why?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Is that all you have to say?
Bree --
Right back at the start, right?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
Yeah.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
John, how are you?
It's in the report.
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I've just got a few --
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Has she talked with you since prison?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Mom, I mean dad?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I think I'm going to throw up.
See you in the morning light.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Is this really your desk?
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Uh, huh?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Who will read me my stories?
Yes.  Very much.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Yes.
Was he unfaithful?
I don't recall.
I suppose...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What?
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
You want what?!
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Joanna, what the hell is--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Only can I still see him?
Wow!
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Yeah.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
All quiet?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Dalai Lama.
I am afraid.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Me. First break of day.
You could buy them.
Is that big?
America, we shall see.
I will not go.
Does he have the spot?
Is that a true story, or pretend?
True.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Yes.
Am I running away?
No.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
I haven't broken any laws.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Jesus Christ!!
Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Right.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
No.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Oh my God.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
That's probably good.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
I'll take it!
He just came up screaming.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
Hey!!
With what?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
What?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
It's ten after nine.
Part of our research--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Why not?
Well, except for the one girl.
What girl?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Are you finished?
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Starling -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
Then please - do this test for me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Ahhh... Why?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I never thought about it.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Was it a butterfly?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
On what basis would they reject him?
Where were you going?
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Thank you, Clarice.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Yes... I did.
We leave in the morning?!
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Let us go, miss.
Why didn't you bury those people?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
Your "father"?
When? How?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Some say that's the way of it.
Head for... for the white water.
We don't.
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
What happened to you?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Such as...?
The honors of war?
My colors?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
I thought they were your friends?
Your suit, Becky!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
We made it!
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
If he had his blinkers on--
What the?...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Getting some food.
What are you going to do to him?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Sixpack...
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Hardly.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
What's that?
They were . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Dog, I have found the cash!
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Who's this fat man, then?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
. . . What?
You got it all?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
You will what?
That you, boy?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I can't help you, Plank.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Look. Go on, look.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
Er, well, twelve.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
So?
I'm sorry, sir.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Yes, sir--
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
So you knew this young man before?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Sergeant?
I'm feeling okay--
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
He swore by it.  What?
Come on in--
Same as they done in Mexico.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
So how come you got into all this?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Maybe.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Black Seminoles?
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
And people make their choice--
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Senora Cruz?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
'57, 1 believe--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Do you?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There was a mandate in the last election--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve?
Why would I want to go there?
There must have been somebody.
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
Not if I can help it.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Okay? He's not here?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
I only went for my last two years.
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Most people did, yeah.
Your boy, there--
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
I been working on a few things.
The Republicans?
They got telephones.
Gotta be in person.
You don't need to cuff me.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Hokey enough for you?
I don't want him getting in the way.
Please.
Yes...
He's with us...
I'm no bodyguard.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
He's good.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Yes.
You can't.
What the fuck?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
And this Butterfield guy--
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
What's the difference?
Any movie stars buried here?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
What the fuck are you doing here?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
I tried to pay you off.
Shit...
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Hold on.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Sure.  Vivovich.
For what?
For an introduction.
Are they all in the business?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
Look, Ma, no wires.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Call me tomorrow.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Nix! Nix!
Is he the Puritan?
Fuck you.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Swann?  What are you doing?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Ok.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
It's Charlotte.
Hans was very attentive to you.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
How old is she?
We should get you to the doctor.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
That's what you said the other night.
You're leaving right now?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Ok, well... I love you.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Alright?
Fine. Is it going ok?
I guess she's busy.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
What?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
How'd it go today?
Like popcorn?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
What?  That's horrible!
What're these?
Seemed...on edge.
I can take care of myself.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Why are you doing this to me?
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
How many weeks are you honey/
You just call?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
What's that got to do with you?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I'll bet.
What do you mean?
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
What?!?!
Trick him.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
We're going to do this.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
He can see you Thursday.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
What's up?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
What?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
I don't remember that.
So you're still breast-feeding?
What?
Sort of.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
You shoot like a girl.
What's up with that?
I was just playing ball.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I never knew a girl that could play.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't have to do what you say.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
God, here we go.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Hey.
Guess not.
None of your business.
What was that about?
Yeah.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Give me the ball.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I...can't.
Quincy...
Hey.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Few days ago.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
What do you mean?
So...how's the knee?
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You're serious.
Better late than never, right?
What will this prove?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
With who?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
We still have to go?
We were just studying.
How was your game?
You scared me.
Why not?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
We need to talk.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Hello?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
I'm here, I'm listening.
Uh-huh.
What kind of Cancer?
It was scary though.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
What the fuck do you want?
baby, please, please --
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
You won't.  You won't have to.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Yeah.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
It's my favorite place --
No, no.
It's fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
It's ok.
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
What?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
C'mon guys, settle down --
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
Sorry, little man.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Finish it up without the lip.
Well --
What?  What does that mean?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
What is that?
Braces.
He has Phil right now.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Hello?
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
She's my mother.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
I wouldn'tve asked --
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I AM CALM.
I went out last night.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
...you know...
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
Willa Cather.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
How do we do this, then?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
No.
I don't know....
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I really don't know.
They look pretty smart, I think.
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Where will the money go?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Hang up the phone.
Pink Dot.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
What is that?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Your Majesty...
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Those can be adopted --
And people close to him, who --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Go on.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
You can't do it.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Who does?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Whose rooms are those?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
A personal nature?
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Your Majesty...?
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... The ball... Continue.
What number, on the first page?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Exactly why it should be given away.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What the hell happened?
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Did you start out area six?
Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Why did you set me up?
No, but I'm listening.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No...I'm in some trouble...
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
And?...
Oh man...what happened?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Ditched you?
Did you have sex with her?
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
What about him?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Run it.
Tell me now.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
That's narrow?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There has to be.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Will...?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
In eight days.
Ride with me.
How did you come to Gateway?
That was nice of you to think of that.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
It's me.
Me.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Yes.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Do you know something about that?
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
We have it good, don't we?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Blue, then.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yes.
Stuart is fine.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Pictures?
I want your opinion.
What do you want?
Fight what?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Tank you veddy much.
No.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Twenty!
Right...
Hi...
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Give me the book.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's so dirty.
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
"Philosophically"?
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
That was a really hot house!
And you are?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Weird.
You got the money?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Is that...?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
How?
They'll be able to track it.
What the fuck do they want with me?!
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Why not?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
This can't be...
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
Of the Resistance.
And she knows what?  Everything?
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
And you still believe I'm the One?
How is he?
You're the Oracle?
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
That's different.
Did you go to her?
What did you just say?
Go!
Do what?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Operator.
It's locked.
Tank, you're hurt.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Well, we want good stuff.
I gotta get the stuff.
'Thou art then a king?'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Panther...
Panther!  Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
What do you mean?
Let's get out of here.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Keep your mouth shut.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
No.
OK, ok...
Nope...
What's a'matter?
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
You're really crazy.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Teresa.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Charlie...?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Hey... you got stereo.
I know...I know.
You mean it's heisted.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Of course.
Annie made them.
Honey, please.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
No, I don't --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
Did you just hear something?
I'm all excited --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Is there any more to it?
No --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Yours.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
No, no.  I on holiday.
You loved back?
Rass!
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You love Allison, don't you?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
You think so?  How do you know?
I'm lost.
'Big'?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Yes?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I don't know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
The 'coffee shop' --
Susan --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Good morning.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
There's one to every rule.
No.
You were just curious?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Say again?
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You fill the bill, Bill.
Speak up, please.
I think you know --
What are you talking about?
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Next week?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
How did you know?
Not my birthday again?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's all?
Bravo.
What?!
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
Where's Joe?
I don't understand.
What a night.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
39.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
66.
Slam it?
Burt.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
You think you can bargain with me?!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You know him?
Why?
I wasn't helping you for money.
How do I know he did that to you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
I'll go see him.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Did you?
Help me.
Don't say another fucking word!
What are you here for?
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
I don't think so.
Prove it.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like what?
How'd you know I was in here?
How do you know him?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
It makes all the difference.					 *
No, you won't.
You won't remember!
I was the kids' godfather.
Sure.
Okay.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Later!  Do you dance?
Died in childbirth, having me...
You know how improbable this is...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I know.  And now?
Red light, green light, José?
Packaging?
Alonzo...
So?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Where the hell are you, man?
Verdado where?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
How?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
What are you talking about?
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
Sonny...?
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
I ain't sleepy.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Oh hell, forget it.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Yeah, well, so?
Don't need a comb.
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
Yeah.
Who?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
They gotta be.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
You bet I do, sir.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
Getchmis olsun
Where?
Who?
To what?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Sixty Lira?
Those mountains? are they?
...are you with the Consulate?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Got a family back there?
Girlfriend?
What they give you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
How long?
What's wrong?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
After we're outside the kogus?
I think I've been poisoned.
You can't take anything seriously.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Jeremy...
Lady...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
The kid's with them!!
I pull.
What?
Which way?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Thought it was my week for that.
Hello.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Then who did?
Misery's Return?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--not fair?
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
That's nice.
What thing?
It's good you found it.
No, the typing kind.
Marcia, please.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
To win?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
And the check's in the mall.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- right..where is it?
- torque wrench.
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
'Terrorists?'
Very.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
By asking me.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
We got it.  On your feet.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
Yeah.  I follow you.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
The arms dealer.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
What are we downloading?
Information.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Very good.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
What about Job?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Bank?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
You're going to use Walter?
Iíve got a shadow.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
And get a doctor.
Why don't you take a look?
Thirty-two and change.
The Shawfish?
Ti amo.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Mona?
What'd you do to your hair?
It's wrong to just let them go.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I don't know.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You don't know nothing about it.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
What about Johnny?
I've never seen a moon like that.
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
Alright.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
He didn't come!
This is your place.
Why?
No.
You've gotta get outta here.
Loretta?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
Yes, on the floor.
What about the wedding?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
WHAT?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Hi.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Moving in?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
You're kidding?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Loretta...
Sure!
Will you join me for dinner?
Don't shit where you eat.
You mean the whole house?
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Look.
You got me.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Yes!
What do you mean?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
No one live there.
Oh!
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Come on then.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Are you sure he's got one?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
What with?
What?
You know my name?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Where?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Be quiet!
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
What is your favorite colour?
I can't.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Farewell, Concorde!
Father, lad.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
But, Father.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
No ... just keep him in here.
No, not anyone else - just me.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
We're coming with you.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
What is your name, handsome knight?
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Well ...
Camelot ...
Why?
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
I don't think I was.
Sir Gawain.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
You've come to rescue me?
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
How much?
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
She'll get over it.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
It's a diary.
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
By whose authority?
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm not married.
Oh.
She'll think I betrayed her.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
They're ready now.
Must they always follow us?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Yes.
The question is, do we need her?
We're going to lose.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Has he been hurt?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Why?
How do you do that?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Now what seems to be the problem?
Sick?
Nick...
What do you mean by "weird"?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
It turned itself back on, Nick.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
Then where do we go?!
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
You got the schematics?
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
I know.
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
What's going on, Cynthia?
What did you say?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Beautiful night.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
I was afraid of that.
There was an accident. I came here.
I don't know.
Unh, unh.
Okay.
Do you know them?!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Go ahead.
You see what I mean...
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Not a coke or anything?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Now where do we go ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
First Bank ? But how ?
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
He hired you to build this place ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
That's not to tough.
Stop the hydraulics.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Trust is earned not given away.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Zachary.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Then what do you want ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
No I am not.
Maybe you should get over fears.
Thank you.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Umm, where do you want this?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
What do you remember about her.
I'm leaving Sunday.
You want me to move?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I know that.
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Vada?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Does it work?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Woah, watch it!
Where are you going???
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
My mother stood on this very spot.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Nick?
Ten bucks.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
But...are you engaged or something?
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
There's plenty of fruit.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You know how I feel about you.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Hey! Oh look.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Of what??
The boss is watching us...
Can't you see it?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Hi.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Oh, how do you mean?
I had a good time tonight.
No, why?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
How's it going chef?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Can we see it from the back yard?
Perfect.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Yes..
I like the freak show.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh come on.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Yes it is.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Sure.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Uh huh, why?
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Jump in the water!!
Why are you running away?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
So now you'll have a mother.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Like this?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Say something it's too quiet.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
I can see why.
You like her.
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
Impressive.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Two words.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
And loving him means loving all of this.
And the answer was so simple.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
So... one almost has to...
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Don't you see...
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Is anybody watching?
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Hate that.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I'm up against a deadline.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
This is her family and her fault.
Thank God you were here.
Jules, what's wrong...
What is that sup...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I won first prize.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Barnett, please -
Then why are you listening to her -
You have to what?
Barnett?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Barbara Jean.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
She's in Paris.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
You got a place to stay?
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
I don't know his first name.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
I'd really like to see you.
Well...How have you been?
Oh.
Doesn't it have a name?
I have to go.
I can't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Hello.
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Where are you going?
I'm Opal.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Got me an audition tonight.
You think I should take lessons?
You serious?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Thank you, sir.
I see.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
It's video.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Says the United States of America.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
I admire them.
Roger?
What the hell happened to you?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Three.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
They done that too long in my family.
Boy - you hear me?!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
You a union man?
No. You got the wrong idea.
I know.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
How 'you doing?
Have anything in mind?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
How 'you doin' man?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
In Birmingham.
They must work on the section gang.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
But I would like to see you again.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
That's the way he is.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
He could live with us.
Huh?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
You will.
What the hell could you do?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
What d'you mean?
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Where' you goin'?
Just get her drunk.
'See ya.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
I asked you somethin', boy!
Couldn't get the words out before.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Well, what're you going to do?
They'll run you out.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I guess not.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
'Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
He's your son.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Take this off.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What the hell is that?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
What are you talking about?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You've got your orders.
Can you read my mind?
Are you even really alive?
The words?
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
It'll flatline your ass.
You're late.
Case.
Where did you here that?
I think you're full of shit.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
What about before that?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
What the fuck... are you serious?
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
I'll get the car.
He projects with neural implants.
What is it?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
College?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Hi!
You need my help?
Hidden camera.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
You've done five of my ideas.
A flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You having fun?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Whoa. Deja Vu.
You like her?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
This seat taken?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
By name.
If you went away, what would become of me?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
Where are you going?
Oh, come on Dad...
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Are you nuts or something?
You're fucked in the head.
How come?
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Are you okay.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What is this place?
About what?
Yeah?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Whoa!
It's gone now.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
So, school going alright?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
I'm serious.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
I'm sure you would.
I thought I'd wait for you.
So what do we do about this creep?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
So?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Ms. Thompson.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Sounds like a rough time.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
The truth.
I've heard crazier things this week.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Who is he?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
What did you think?
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
I'm not listening.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Sorry about that...
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh -- Okay.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
What did you say?
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Yup.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Okay.
I thought I'd give it to you.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Miracles do happen.
That's right.
Where are you going?
Anna Scott?
Yes.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
No -- it's my 22nd.
What happened?
Ahm... room service.
Max.  This is Anna.
Cool, huh?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
And she's in your house.
Was it you?
What's going on?
What?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Who? Tell me!
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
I wanna report a robbery!
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
H-Hey, M-Mack.
H-H-Help!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Marry who?
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
What for?
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
I'll bet a dollar.
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Lobotomy!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Don't you have any clubs?
No!
Yeah, buddy?
What's this?
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
I see.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
I don't, Doc...
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Yeah, buddy?
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
What's going on?
A dime.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Huh?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Bet you ass...
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Why, sure, ma'am...
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Oh, yeah...
You ask what room he's in, okay?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
What?
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hi there...
Congratulations.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
NO.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Where's Positano?
Why?
You aren't?
There's no such thing.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
What would you call it?
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Well, not exactly...
So what do you think?
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
No.  He smokes.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Is he gay?
But what?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
But it's July.
Live happily ever after.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
'Course he does.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
What did you say to her?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
I meant about my idea.
Why?
Whatareyoudoing?!
And he is living proof.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
And you are?...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
No, why?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Yeah--
I have to talk to her.
I'm gonna take her home first.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
Well, where are they?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
It'll do.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Don't say that!
Don't say that!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
None of your business.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
What's that?
I only live up there and across the roof.
What for?
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Now what are you doing?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
What are you crying for?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
He wanted to see me again.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
What do you want from me, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
So help me God!
Listen, this ain't for publication.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
No.
Take it easy now, Terry.
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Listen— Nolan—
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
...And what is this?
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You better hope there is.
Then why do you shake so?
No. No! No!
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
You didn't visit him in prison.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
It's Richard Ripley.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
What?!
Jack?
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
How long you talk to her?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yes, she did.
You know how I felt about her.
They found the safe.
Shit.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
In the trunk, yeah?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Daniel.  Listen --
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
You excited?
Why you think is today?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Karen, I told you not to--
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Who's sitting here?
We're leaving.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
Good luck, Richard.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
I thought so, too.
Uh-huh.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
You won't do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
What, as a sales rep?
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You coming back?
You just did, for Christ sake.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Of course not.
It's a little late for me.
The fish?
Have they got Midge up there?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning?
Hejira.
You don't remember me, do you?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Glenn, take the exit.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
I can tell.
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Thanks, Dad.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
You were talking in your sleep.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Are you sure they're here?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You liked that?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Then why are you looking for her?
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Land of the free.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Yeah.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
How's everything?
Well...sure.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
What do you get for winning?
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
How do you like my hair?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Why wait?
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
I've got to go now.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
All right. But this better be good.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
What are you doing?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
What are you talking about?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
How long ago did this guy retire?
Who was that?
Just out.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Is this a good spot?
I'm not burying him here...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What's wrong with your face?
Why, Beckett?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
It could be parasites, an infection...
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
What's that mean?!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Continue.
I buy that.
How did they find out?
Uh huh...
What have you prayed for?
I know a good probate lawyer.
What impressed you about him?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?
Yes. On my torso.
Thanks for coming by.
Gay movies.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
That's right.
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Yes.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Second.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Now that you mention it...
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
He was doing a great job.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
What about her?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
You sure you can keep --
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Just give me your hand.
Possibly.
Hey.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Well, don't ask me to.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Well? Is it just the pump?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Company's not here, is it?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Which half?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Well, what's it look like now?
Such as.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
The evidence was very meager --
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Any particular reason?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
He's trying to form words.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
He wouldn't leave her.
Who put them up?
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Read it yourself.
No.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
What is this?
Which one?
Are you going to take her with you?
Yes.
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
It's humiliating.
He's moving his fingers!
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
But the proof? The doll?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Sarge?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
I was wrong.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I volunteered.
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I'm sure you have.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
No, please.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
What time is it?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
You don't know who he is?
So have I.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
No percentage in that.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Cold?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Points very straight to her.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
To do what?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
What'll you have, Margo?
Where?
It was lying where on the balcony?
How about a cup of coffee?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You'd be breaking the law.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
What?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
You in charge here?
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Was that about the right angle?
Where's the shell?
Do I know who lives down there?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
What are my orders, sir?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
You ought to know why.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
That's not very kind.
It's kind of you to see me.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
What went wrong?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Freshman and sophomores...
Can I give you a lift?
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Damn.  They're early.
In radio we're different.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't seen much of you.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Let me see.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
What about the Cromwells?
Yes.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
Where's Roach?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Fine.
Babes.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
What story did you give to Davis?
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I'll see you there.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Please, we hardly know each other.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
You looking' for some company?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
What motel you staying at?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Fine.
Get in.  This side.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Always.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
What do you like?
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
No.
He's good at what he does.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Vivian...
Edward, I can't.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What do you mean?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It was good.
You're packing.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
We're letting them slide?
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Yes...
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Give me twenty minutes.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Was that you?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit give me nothin'.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
You're a guest here?
But I always eat like this.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian --
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I don't think it would fit you.
Having a good time, Vivian?
He will come for me.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Rest, Highness.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
What do I do?
It's you.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
-- what? --
-- where?
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
What?
What?
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Now?
-- yes --
Sir. Sir.
Hah?
Humiliations galore!
Making sure nobody's following us.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Go in, get after her!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I accept.
You've made your decision then7
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
I have hurt your feelings.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Assume away!
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What are you doing?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Of Siegfried...
The Graf Spee...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
What do you do best?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
No.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Anyone at home?
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
How much?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Were there any calls?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She stole some money.
Forty thousand dollars.
With the forty thousand dollars?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
What do you know about it?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
I feel better when you feel better.
Where's the old highway?
Arbogast said...
Sam, I'm going.
In a hurry.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Why not?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam. This is the last time.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
You go out... with friends?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
Oh?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Yes.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
My mother is not dead!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
...Forty thousand dollars!
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
Did you wish to see someone?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Maybe you're right.
Well, news of Buckley?
Take me down there.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
What were you dreaming about?
That called ... commanded ...
No?
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
What are you laughing at?
Did you? Where?
There's no hurry. It's early.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Now don't that call for an extra!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
I see. Was that all she said?
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
What are you laughing at?
Excuse me???
I'm heading out of town.
Well, I got to see her.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Where is she?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Nobody.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Well, some fiend might.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
I got an awful toothache.
What are you going to do, Rose?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
What did you say, Brother?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
They're discussing it.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
That's what she would say herself.
A wonderful woman, boy.
No, son, she is dead.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
I am ahead of you.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Oh. Did you say something?
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
You're not having lunch?
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Quarter of twelve.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Who?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Rose, what are you doing up?
Got yourself up?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Mine.
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
What... ?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
That wasn't my fault.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
No offices are gonna be open today.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
They shot us all, kid.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
What's mine say?
It doesn't say that.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Can't you say something nice once?
No.
Nope.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Yeah... great.
You know what I mean.
I'm gonna get beside him.
Oh yeah?
You get him?
Dead.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
This shit was Ming.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
I can't do it, Ben.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
I have felt him, my Master.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Yes.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
Told you, did he?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Right!
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
What guy
Goodbye
Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
Yes.
It's not that --
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
I always knew you was pretty.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Yes.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Don't say that.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
What?!
My side.
You're hurtin', man!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
...It's very American.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Of wa?
I don't like ya face.
...That's an old one.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Ten minutes.
Nine minutes!
A hundred an' thirty.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Yeah.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Rocky.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Stuff it, man!
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What was I gonna say?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...Tomato?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Yeah.
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Please, kid.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Looks, huh?
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
It don't matter.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Gazzo's a good man.
Whatta you think?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
To see ya train.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
So altruistic.
Where is he?
How did you get onto Doom?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Now what?
I don't work in Toontown.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I've already seen your photographs.
Aah!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Does this help?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Wrong number?
Two bits.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
A challenge, on my life.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Ahhh!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
By the hour of nine.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
It's under your seat.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
So where do you go from here?
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
It's been known to happen.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I'm a patriate.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Bad company...
Whoever hired us.
Then where is it?
So what do we do?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Soon.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
I do.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Know what?
You were smoking?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
The Irish representative?
It's my job.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
That's a good question.
And now...
What of it?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What happened to it?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Sort of!
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
At the expense of six people.
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I...I can't do that.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
It's NOT too late!
And you're solid on that?
Why don't you get to the point.
I'm all ears.
How much?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
What for?
Nothing happened?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
I guess we can get started.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
You'd do this to me?!
Hi ma.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Not in the trunk.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I'm not getting an answer.
How much is that?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
What?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Yeah, that's right.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I'm sorry.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
What's wrong?
It's my job!
No.  She's a school teacher.
You're not very good at this, are you?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Why LA?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Who?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Slow down, baby.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Hello, Benjamin.
Vegas...
We made it, man.
Yes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
OK. Say what it is.
Sir, I can explain.
He stole my wheel!
No.
You speak English!
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
He was trying to kill me, not you.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Now, that's American music.
That's not how it goes.
Which one?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
It's called a dress.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
You don't like it?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How much they want?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
Hello.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I still have work to do here.
I'm not running.
Really?
Got any last minute advice?
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Make the shot."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Then you'll be my best man.
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Getting nervous?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
We'll see.
Really?
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
Highly suspect.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
Lighten up, what?
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
I'm just finishing up, too.
What are you talking about?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Walter, I'd love to --
You go.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
It was my mother's.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
Actually, he sounded nice.
I should say something in this about magic.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Men never get this movie.
What?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
You know.
Who is this?
Have you had any relationship since?
Why not?
It's not that late in Seattle.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You'll see.
You think so?
Yeah.  What's that?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
It was sinking.
Not now, Jonah --
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Don't ever do that again.
It's a short word.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
You said we could go to New York.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Okay.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
The woman question?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What makes you so sure?
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Can be what?
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
No ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
That's it?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Why not?
Why don't you call the cops?
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I know a guy.
My features. They're Finnish.
You on a roll?
What?
Can your man handle that?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Sure, Jimmy.
Why?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
Can we talk price?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Jesus.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
He knows somebody ratted him.
What's that smell?
You're lucky, Flynne.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
When is the deal going down?
Just admit you're wrong.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
But, sir...I...I...
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
The Army gave you that?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Not yet.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
Senator's son?
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
GO!
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Worked, didn't it?
You think they'll be alright?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
How about I go right, sir?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And what about your own hand?
Oh, yeah?
You're welcome, John.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Yes, sir.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
And Sarge?
Lingerie.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
Because he's guilty.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Oh yeah!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
I love you dad.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
This is me telling you about me.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
What are these?
Stop by later.
Yes.
Yeah.  With potential.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
Then why are you shaking?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
No, no.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I love you.
I'm fine.
Okay.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
YEAH!
The truck?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How do you pay for one of those?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
I love you man
Now you're back.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Luck.
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
They're not gone, they're here.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Like this?
What are you doing?
Pistols?
That'd be fine.
I was just the accountant.
Christmas presents.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
Four hundred, four fifty -
That's very generous of you.
They arrived.
I didn't do enough.
We know that, son.
How's the name search going?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
What if I said you?
I live here.
I did that.
What?
You have a right to be angry.
And are the police sure about that?
Yeah.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Where's Sid?
You’re the one who got away.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Miss Weathers.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Let's go.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
The young girl is slashed again.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
What's your favorite scary movie?
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Melinda McGraw?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Did you request this case?
To me Hollywood is about death.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Yeah?
Where are you Dewey?
Where's Gale?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
You used to say that was our strength.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
What?
Thank you.
Sidney, what happened?
But you know who she was.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Yeah.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
You're dead!
Where?
Close call.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Are you serious?
Who did you call?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I don't understand...
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
Do I?
Uh-huh.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I don't know...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Sidney's father?
I don't know. I guess.
Any word on my Dad?
Yeah.
Have they found my father?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Have you contacted the bureau?
Where is she?
What's the plan?
What's the delay?
I'll look for it.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Many times.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
She's saving herself for you.
Are you serious?
No way.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
And you believe it?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Who?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
TATUM!
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
That's mature.
Have you heard?
Already.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What time is it?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
You should be thanking me.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I realize that.
Who said this was murder?
No.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Is that clear?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Nothing.
It is Victor.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
And so what?
So they ran our list.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
We need a warrant.
What are you talking about?
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
He's preaching.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
I don't see anything.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Did the wife confess?
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
How's California?
You askin' me to clear out now?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Told ya, didn't I?
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
What you want me to call you?
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
What?
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
You ask her!
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
I think maybe we oughta...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Might at least have left me my pants!
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I mean the armchair!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
We just have to make a new beginning.
So do I, believe me.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Where have you been all day?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Martin, what-
How did you get me out of there?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Mrs. Straub!
I've killed my husband!
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Will…Where is Mercutio?
Ned…I know…I know
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
You have the last act?
Twenty pounds on delivery
Never!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Are you writing?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Ten pounds.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Yes, I saw it.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
But nothing is happening.
it will be all right, madam.
Another little problem.
How will it?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Verona again.
Your Majesty!
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
I would not for the world!
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Better fortune, boy.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
The same, alas.
I do not know how to undress a man.
And that was only my first try.
Then I will go with you.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But all ends well.
My lady VIOLA.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
It is only ours you can know.
Your aunt?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
She sings too?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
About this guy, this Hugo person.
You think so?
He couldn't get his car started.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't know.
But not quite.
I want to talk now.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
So I gathered.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Well?
But there's no --
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Well, she had problems --
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
Alex.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Stop nagging.
Love and happiness for ever.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
That's not him.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
David?
Forget it.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I see.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Would you like to talk about it?
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
But they sneer, don't they?
What happened to that guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
You must be Juliet.
What do you do?
It was some guy called Brian.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Why?
Yes, but... I thought...
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I'll be back in a while.
Calm down, baby.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
Why don't you see Lester?
Is she all right?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
You know what I'm talking about.
No thanks.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not!
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right, that's right.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
No.
I just have to do one little thing.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
-- you are.
-- gee...
You were great.
Mmmm --
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- we are?
-- It's Malone's.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Jackie Shawn.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
What's gonna happen?
You're different.
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
We live together now.
Maybe you don't even like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Hey, I'm, you know --
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Yeah, baby.
About what?
What do you want?
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Jill says nothing.
Who?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I know, honey.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Now, Jackie --
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I wish you'd go now.
George...
But Mr. Norman said --
But what?
Have a drink.
She's nothing but a whore.
I'll call you back.
I was too old.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I am?
Who were you talking to?
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Here.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I'll call you.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Don't be silly.
Five times a day?
How much?
Jackie --
Well yes -- you know that about George.
What?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
-- uhh-huhh...
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Egypt?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Sort of.
I'm terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
I don't think so.
You're kidding.
What's wrong?
You seem disappointed.
No.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Are you having a good time?
Dad?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Tony.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Maybe he showed me something.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Yeah.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
It's so pretty.
I won't make any noise.
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Because he hides.
To my stomach.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
What sort of injury did he have?
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Yes, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
A nigger!
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Beg pardon?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Wendy!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Wendy...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
can of itself be a problem.
Not for me.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Fine.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
You booger.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
What the hell does that matter?
I told you!
There! You see!
But Uncle Al! You said-
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Yes?
Yes, Betty?
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Is this... choir practice?
I know.  It's ancient.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
It's true -- I know her.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?
Wet behind the ears.
It'll be hell.
Is there any syrup?
I... I brought you something.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Are you leaving us?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
No!  No!  I can't do this!
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
What's wrong with my life?
Sometimes it's not enough!
It never solves anything.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
What?
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
A vote?
I must go where I can be of use.
What are you doing here?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Then one day they find you.
I can't see anything in here!
Sister Mary Patrick?
He's not like other guys.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
If we could speak alone.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Certainly not.
What the hell are you doing?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I hit him square.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
What are you spying on?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
You need to sleep.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
What is the common thread between these victims?
It's spectacular.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
In test... what?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Climb up!
Other people?
Are you so superstitious?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
And, what did he say?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
What did you say?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
Thank ye.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
I don't reckon.
That boy wants me to.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Thank ye.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Can I see him?
What you got that's good to eat?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Please Doyle, don't.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
I ain't sure.
Sure, I guess.
You got that shit right.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Are you well?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Who did you kill?
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
You want to go with me?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I don't reckon I know.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
A little ol' boy.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
You will? For sure?
Can we play ever' Saturday?
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
So, you're really going to stay here?
Did you knock on the door yet?
I done et just a little bit ago.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
He just got out of the state hospital.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
No thank you.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Not an easy book.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Are you closed?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
It's all yours, baby.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
It's for you.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And you told your nephew about it?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
The what?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
And?
The inspiration.
The end.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
And started to run.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
I'm not going to do it.
Fries?
Yes, please.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
A thousand.
Closer to eight.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
And the next one...?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Still lashed to the mast.
You always run with the well open?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Apparently.
I believe so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Well...
The same.
Are you absol...
He had no reason to.
Are these your bags?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Beat it, Buster.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Funny?  In what way?
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
I told you - it's a sure thing.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Good night, Daphne.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Did you hear that?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
We'll take a rain check.
Stay as long as you'd like.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Interesting.
That's ridiculous.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
I guess she's not in here.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You invest in shows?
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Pleased to meet you.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
What's the job?
Why?
Well, here we are.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
I'll say.
That so?
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
Glasses?
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
Oh?
Shell Oil?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
I seem to be out of gas.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
What's on Thursdays?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Complete washout.
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good night.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
I know.  Every time!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Big joke!
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Pub Golf?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Um, just about everyone.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Shrink, actually.
Mission accomplished.
I don’t know.
What does your gut say?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
Are you sure?
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Hi, kiddo.
It’s complicated, Dad.
What is it you do again?
Uh huh...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Nothin'...
And so you did your job, right?
Go on...
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
What happened afta that?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
Sunday...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
David!
What's in there, David!?
I don't look like no possum!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Ready to go, Mama!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Can't sleep?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
What?
Doggy.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Come on, just get to the message board!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Oh yeah.
Hello there, children!!
May I?
What's that?
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
That was sweet!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Wow!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Yeah, so what do we say?
WHAT?
Thank you, Kenny.
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You know I do.
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
What are we going to do?
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
He certainly is polite.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
What?  What are you talking about?
But how are you going to escape?
I'm in the bridge.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
I'm looking for a man.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Sure, Sid.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Son?
What did you do to Buzz?
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
No!
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
What's your specialty?
Too late for what, Sheila?
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
You should.
Where are you going?
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What about plan C?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
It's burning...
Fletcher!  Now!
Norman!
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nobody move.
But she's --
Direction's east coming!
What do we use for defense?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- and then brought her down here --
You think he killed Edmunds?
Can you open that panel?
Nothing, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
What?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
What?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
We had considered it.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
How can he be missing?
To what?
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Underwater?
What do you mean -- not normal?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What are they?
In Edmunds' things.
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
You get it straightened out?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
We must've had it delivered then.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
But why is he doing it?
Looks like some sort of code.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Don't you?
He can't manifest.
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
But I have to, Norman.
Stop it!
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
We can refuse to talk.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
I'm not being defensive.
C'mon, Norman.
Not a clue.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
What noise?
Norman?
What is it, Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
She's cracking, Norman.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
No idea.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Meaning?
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Well, if it's a discharge --
He wasn't feeling well.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
The creature?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Was it a military crash?
Well, we'll see...
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Who are you anyway?
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Are you sure you don't need it?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
What about the princess?
The Kiber Crystal.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Is he afraid of the water?
They'll find its weakness.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Mobile Infantery rules !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Profile's wrong... there.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Yeah.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
You're late.
I'm gonna miss you.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Uh, look, Diz...
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Courage, I guess.
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
On whose authority, Corporal ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
Can you walk ?
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
What is your position ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Who is V'ger?
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Yes.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Then you acted properly, of course.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Hello, Ilia.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Hold station.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
I have one, but they lost it.
I quit.
You quit.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
But why the dalmation?
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Of course.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Paperclip?
Oh, God...
Thank you.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Gosh, you look nice.
Oh yeah.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
But that's what happened.
Carla was in the car, right?
What are you going to do?
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
No.  Don't tell me that.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
How old are you?
I...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
It's night.
I think he's moved...
Nobody.
I wasn't in the car.
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
She's absolutely r...
You have to hide.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
That's cor...
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Why?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You should.
A witness to what...?
The writer.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
What's the...
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
<u>Siddown</u>!
You cool the broad out?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
We got the permit.
Do something.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
And we're glad to have you here...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...the city council...
You hear that?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Zat true?
Why?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Ben!  What's wrong?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
It happens.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Scream.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
So why are you asking me?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
That happens.  To families.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
Great.
Not with my mouth open.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
You touched it.
No.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
What honey?
Mommy's sick, guys.
So you're okay.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I'm here.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's a huge moment in their life --
WE are over.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I need practice.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Can I look at the pictures?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
No, there isn't.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
They don't hate you --
She's not gonna die.
No problem.
Restless.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Maybe he's gay.
Out! Leave the table!
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Yes, Mikey?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
This is work.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My baby.
He's dead.
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
I know!
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Was anyone in my room today?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
So? How was school today?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you're home early!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
'Fuck me hard!'
Yeah. But not any more.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah, sure.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Whoopee.
But what did you get on your SATs?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Where does it lead?
You're going to pay for this...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
What the hell is it, anyhow?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Get your men to do it!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
That's right, fella.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Yes?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Suppose that were the case?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I'm trying to, sir.
I guess so.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Do you think they would cheat?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Then there's no chance for recall?
They're coming in now.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
A through H is correct.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
I think they mean business.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Some kind of signaling.
That's what I said.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
I don't get you, King.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
I don't anymore.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Slides go with it.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Hey!
Yup.
A cloud.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
And your mom.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Sorry.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Fuck it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Score! Yeah!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
It's safe, come on.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Whoa!
You could do it.
Yeah!
You rich?
He is.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Who were you talking to?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
See ya later.
What?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
I hit her.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your sure as hell right about that.
Like what?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It was a racial incident.
Oh, yeah?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?
Go.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Now?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Hey, where's Erica?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Get off my roof!
Pony, oh my god!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If...
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
No car.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Diane?  Diane!
You sure?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Oh no...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
You're kidding.
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Definitely old.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You sure you wanna go there?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
In a deep freeze.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
What has Artie to do with it.
It will?
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Second generation, huh?
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't want it now.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
No.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
You're a writer, you said.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
This is fascinating.
I want you to do this work.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There sure is.
You can stay here.
Cut away from me?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
You think this is all very funny.
What's that?
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Good.
Why do you say that?
Wanted what?
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Joseph C. Gillis?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
You know better than to interrupt me.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
You think so?
Hmmm?
A little.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse!
What about my proposal?
Someone's chasing him.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
What's a tree?
Where is Earth?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
She did that deliberately.
Your hair looks the same.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Balefire on you, Selena!
I have to talk to you.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Others?
It's lovely. . .
But it's impossible.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Tuesday.
Brad.
You know what's the problem?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
He really was!
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Man, what is this?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
I didn't have my camera with me.
Thank ...you.
We've already met.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Diet soda?
I don't kiss.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
She's not his mama either.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, you're amazing.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Sleep well?
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Uh...home...
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It has everything.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
DELETE IN CUTTING
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
What do you want?
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
I'm not so sure you do.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
An angle?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
You think he'll find us.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Bunkers!
You're a great architect, Albert.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I'd like to.
No.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
But otherwise it's swell.
Hey!
He may have a gun!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Again???
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I don't understand.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
What other one?
He will be odd, different.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Superman???
I came to talk to you.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
195 pounds.
Uh-huh.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
What happened?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I can help you.
Case?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
A while.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Your kids never cry.
You're leaving.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
For rabbits?
From what?
That's right.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
You want a cup of tea or something?
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
How was it?
Yes.
When?
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
How old is she?
Here we go.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Who did they get for that?
You think someone else caused the accident?
What time in the morning was this?
You could see the speedometer?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
Really?
You mean it?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
What are you up to, Nicole?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Why, has he bothered you before?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
How?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
You're incapable of the truth...
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
This sort of thing!
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
I'm used to you...
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
It is a favor, isn't it?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
If the stores are open -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
We should abort.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
You sure?
Affirmative.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
This is tactically dangerous.
Drive for a minute.
I have to go away, John.
Out of the way, John!
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know!
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Relax now, Sarah --
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Yeah.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Three months.
What's not right?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I don't buy that.
May I ask a question?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who warned you?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Helmuth.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
The Miracle Kid.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
They said I was dogged?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
You can't to that...
You're a big help.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
You cold?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Bag some Z's?
What about it?
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
I bet you're ticklish.
I don't think I like this.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Give me the short version.
Call her.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
It was an accident.
It was a gift... from my brother.
Don't even think about it.
What's C.R.S.?
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
No!  I'm sick of this...
Who are "they?"
That's a lie...
Who is it?
I'm back from the dead.
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
... what... ?
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
What are you doing?
No...
Stop it!
I have to show you...
Julliard, yeah.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
No.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
What's this all about, Connie?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Slow down, take a breath...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
I'll explain someday.
We provide whatever's lacking.
How long will these take?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You did?  How is he?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Look, where is he?!
No.
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
What the fuck... ?!
Why are you following me?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Attractive...
What?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
That could have been worse.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
And those are Luke's and mine.
You're not telling us something.
Well, this lot is full!
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
All the carvings.
She needs help.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Oh!  You scared me.
Is there something about the house?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Not really.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
How could he have left without his keys?
David.
Why?
Are you sure?
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Not for you, clearly.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
What kind of food?
I like the colors.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Hey.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Been to the Boat Show.
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Has he?
What's so fucking funny?
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
No one else is even here yet.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
I've been wondering something.
Not her brand.
Sort a few things out.
How d'you mean?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Footloose and fancy free.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Your employer?
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
So what's your beef, pal?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Five thousand.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Where is he, then?
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
I don't.
Yes, Ann?
...Yes?
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
We've certainly missed you.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Geez, Mr Crane.
He didn't say that.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah... it's nothing.
You're an enthusiast.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Cash.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Oh, hell. Drink?
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh?
Whuddya mean?
Uh-huh.
Could you come with me please?
Second chair.
Why not?
Where's the walk-in safe?
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Hurry up!
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Fifteen... what's next?
The body?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
This place is a maze.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What's that?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I don't understand.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Is there another way around?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
A window onto the human condition?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
What's he doing?
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Nursery?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
How about them?
No.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
I think you better tell us.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Brought on by what?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You follow me out here for a reason?
What was it?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
You didn't know my father --
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
Jesus, Mulder...
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
All I told them was the truth.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
All the equipment is brand new.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
I can't go any farther.
I don't have his number.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Mr. Mulder.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
What is it?
You're lying.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Why are you telling me this?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
I do it all the time!
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
No.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What about Julia?
Wait...
COME ON!
You sure about this?
Yep.  Eloped.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
How's the patient.
Now?
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Yes.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
...to steal my girl.
I thought you wanted...
Holly.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
He liked to laugh.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
His.
Oh, well.
...quarrel?
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
I don't want it.
Martins.
I can't say that I have.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
This is where he vanished.
Fifty yards right down there.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Of course.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Do you know his number?
Welcome?
I know a very good dentist.
Hello, Harry.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Baron Kurtz.
...Popescu...
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Kurtz.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Joseph Harbin.
Okay.
I'm Daffy.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
What!
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Hi.
Have you told someone?
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
What??
Who the fuck are you?
What, do you like it here?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Too difficult?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
What about Curtis Zampf?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
To hear them read Torah.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
You could do it.
What is it?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Are you an artist?
It's Friday....
Fund-raising??
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
You're going to live here permanently?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Did you tell him?
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Yes.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
And just where are you from?
Checking out the competition.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Don't.
Where did you get that?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Well, what are they?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
What?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
You were right.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I recognize you.
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thank you...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
So have I.  ... Hello?
No... tell me.
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
What?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Why?
Anything.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Who... Who is that?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Please, call me Mordechai.
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Want to get a drink?
What!?
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
You two know each other?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Cool. What's it do?
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
Get off of me you cripple!
Is he in love with you?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
I drink.
Then what do you do?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
I want him to lock me up.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Hey —— I'm over here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Why?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
What are you getting at?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Clo-Clo?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
Yeah.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
I know -- Teresa -—
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leon’s?
What... What are you talking about?
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Mr Lombard...
I’m really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
Leon hung himself.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
To get me killed...?
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
Croissants.
The word for those things is croissants.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
What kids?
I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
It’s not.
Piss off!
I hope it’s not too significant.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Anything at all?
This car needs petrol.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Three o’clock.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Have you?
Your lady friend did.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Should I be?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Good reasons?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Alors?
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Well...
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
But... why... what's the point?
I'm already free...
I -- I don't understand...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
I tried to.
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
No, I... I held it up to...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
What were you doing when the voice came?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
But... her army's so small now...
I'm... I'm not the king...
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
Go on to the next question.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
No...
Yes, but...
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why were you yelling like that?!
My... visions...
What signs?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
In His name??
Do you think this cross will protect you?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
Only God knows the answer to that.
A beauty. Who is she?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
And how's Yurek?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
I'll be fine.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Cow!
You made contact?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, I don't think so?
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Szpilman.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She wants it to come.
What does she say?
That's right.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Then why you doin' it?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
See and raise five.
I guess I left it in my room.
Who are you?
I'll square it with the fixer.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
But what about all these other people?
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
All right, when?
Hooker!
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
No.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
No.
Don't think I know him.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
I'll make parole.
We missed him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Why not?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
You're high enough.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Yes.
Why... in the heart.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
You see how much we have to say.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Did you kill her?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
This gun yours?
You mean about that gun?
What do you mean?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Could this be him?
Well, what?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Good morning --
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's my business.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
But what if you need more money?
You don't say --
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
It might.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
But it's Christmas now.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Sure I will.
He was down in the shop.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Couple of months anyway.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Got a nice evening dress?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Bonds, sir?
Maybe she has.
Home!
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
What are you doing.
Epps!
You got no reason to do that!
Get off him.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
You said he was a deserter.
You're out of your mind.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Give it to me!
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
They'll shoot us!
Oh, God!  Oh God!
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
This.  Whatever it is.
Don't!
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
What?
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Wes is dead!
No.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Sure.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
No!
Just let me rest for a second.
Don't you touch it.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Oh, God...
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
To where?
I don't know!
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Australia.
Woods.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You get it yet?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
Jaeger?
We...we could go home with something else.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Yeah!  Yeah!
I thought we were dead.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
I think he wants something to drink.
Control ON.
Look, food!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX!
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
I knew him.
No......  She's dead THX........
Where's LUH?
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
They're not here.
Coffee, Mike?
What're you talking about?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
What?
More metal... sharp edge...
Yeah, another round thing.
"Punks", huh?
You got it.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Glass, what is it?
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Thank you.
Alex-
Drop it.
What the hell's going on?
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
How're you guys doing?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Make an appointment.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Report on the case so far.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
No!
<u>Niente!</u>
About tonsils.
Amsterdam?
But--
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Like it?
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
You can trust me.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
M'sieu ...
Thank you, Major. 
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
The pepper, too?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
By the way, how is your German?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
And you--
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
Yes, I would!
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes, madame!
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Don't you mean work me?
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
How you two doin'?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Why have we stopped?
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
I know what ice fishing is!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
It is that simple.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
May I cut in, miss?
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Are you nervous?
Could it have damaged the ship?
It's bad.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
Don't come any closer.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
It's so unfair.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
I can explain--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
Montana?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
You've got lipstick all over you.
When?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
A little.
Thanks.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Lonesome?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
This is a business trip!
Are you screwy?
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
Come in! 
I'm going to the show--
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
I should say not.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
O.K.! Send that!
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Knots!
Who won?
McKinney's the name.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
I didn't--
No--not much--excepting-- 
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Is that one of the Who's Who?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
About twelve hundred.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I don't understand.
Come and get him.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Forget it.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
How you feeling, Doc?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
That's great coming from you.
Then what do I do?
Don't touch me!
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
What?
Good God, you're really-
You know, we might just pull this off.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
I laugh sometimes
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Wyatt!  My God...
Really?  You sure?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Virgil?
How did you get this number?
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Paris -
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I got you covered.
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
If I were you -
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Sleep well?
... Yes?
And number two?
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Oh, no.
Will the cruise set it off?
I pay my own way.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
What for?
Harry is coming to pick me up.
I'm busy.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
Since this morning.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Good morning.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
You should go back and rest.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Let me get you a cup?
You must have done something to her.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
How are you?
Wow!  Cool!
Yeah!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Here!  In the car!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't tell me what to do!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Who is it this time?
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Who's there?
Did you do this?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Don't bother.
So my wife is lying?
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
How long have you known?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Should we bring the police into this?
Me, too.
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What's up?
You all right?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Live with your parents?
I'm third in my class.
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
You may speak.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Yes, sir!
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Madrigal's alive.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
It's possible.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
Twenty thousand.
What?
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Come on.
Yes.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
So why have you told me about it?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, really?
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Are you getting out much?
Exactly.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Director?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Despite the Academy award?
That's your theory?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
It wasn't that bad.
God, you're sick.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
How much?
But you don't have the money?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
There.
It's the great outdoors.
It's fresh air.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
What?
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
The ship....
Following new course. Warp seven.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Who is it he reminds you of?
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
You must allow us to act.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Is what possible?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
A "t."
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Spock... don't.
Now learn something about yourself.
Your vision?
You are mad!
The ship needs its Captain.
Borgus Frat.
Spock?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok.
Hi, Alan.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
You call that getting over it?
To warn him.
Of what?
Beautiful!
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
The Pentagon?
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
How about over there...that empty memory?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Watch it!
Hey... !
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
The Users...you really think they're still there?
What do you think?
You bitch.
Where are you going?
That's not true, honey--
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you off to young lady?
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
I thought you moved out.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Now what?
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
I'm late.
Uh huh.  Okay.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What'd you do, honey?
What did happen?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
I can do it!
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
It makes you tell the truth?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What does she do?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
What?
Get going! 
What's going on, Harry?
Tell me what happened?
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
What is it you need me to do?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
'Bout twelve.
What do you want to know?
I don't remember.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Very much. Now, where were we?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Is he black?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
You will?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You got it.
That's a pretty amazing story.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
This shit can't be real.
I know.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No. No, you don't.
Where's everybody else?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I got some money I can give you -
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure. No problem.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do.
He saw the wire.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
I didn't mean -
We want you to tell us about last night.
Well?
So that...???
Do you know why you're here, James.
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
No more drugs.  Please...
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
You want me to rob him?
You... you left them a message?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
You really want to know?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Nothing.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
It will.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Harlin around?
Don't look like nothing.
How much?
You believe that?
Two-hundred.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Kirin?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're not from around here, are you?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Least you can leave.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
A medicine man?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You just walk away.
Have you ever been there before?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Where?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
He was going to take the money.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
John!
John, throw me the keys.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Someone will find me.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I have half a mind to--
Live there?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Do we shake hands?
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You love her, but you hate her?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Drop it, Jake.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Jake--
It's the truth, Jake.
I want to stay.
Got any requests?
I've had time to get over it.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
You expect me to believe that?
You're fucked.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I said I was sorry.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
What the fuck do you want?
Bobby Cooper.
Wait a second--
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
What happened to your hand?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
Nope.  Darrell.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You believe that?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
It's Grace.
No, I've got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
What happens when you lose?
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I'm sorry...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
What do you mean?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I can't see it.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I busted my leg!
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
I need a ticket.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
I want to stay.
Is Noel in?
Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
What does that mean?
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
When was the last time I wore pink?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Yes.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Like what?
Yes.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
Are you finished?
Yeah?
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
Is that right?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
What'd he say?
He tell you where them others is?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
What business?
They takin' water?
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
I... I... think I'm... shot.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Huh?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
Sally?
Well, she...
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Did you... did you... ?
Did I what?
Who said that?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Nothin's bent.
Jesus.  You done this before?
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
Keyser Soze
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They'll never stop.
I know who he is.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
You heard right.
Me too.
Did you hear what he just said?
You okay?
Maybe more.
Keaton, I can't just -
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
How are you, Keaton?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Who is he?
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
This is totally irrelevant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Well, we...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
How is that?
Through, through his book.
Huh!
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
That's not my handwriting.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
She getting good care over there?
Her doctors killed her.
The most respected ...
... that's perfectly all right.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Why is that?
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Pardon?
The TV didn't work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
What happened...?
Yes.
I...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Is it over?
... now who is that ...?
...I'm going to need your help...
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
She did?
Who told you that?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
A single hour.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
As I've said we had some more...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
I -- I --
Hello.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
You.
You're not far wrong.
About three years.
Why?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Tomorrow night? Well --
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Yes.
I need you.
I'm scared.
Scottie --
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Some people prefer it.
I don't know.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
No birds live here.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where are you now?
Have you been here before?
Where were you born?
No!
No, I can't tell you!
Vaguely...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Would you know the room?
There's a name on the gravestone.
Yes --
Tell me.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Please answer my question.
Carlotta Valdes?
Would you please go and look?
I had to quit, Midge.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Uh-huh!
Well?
Three whole weeks.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
The poor thing....
Out!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
She'll be out in a moment.
How ya doing?
What did you say?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
Why?
And you're a little fucking reject.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Just stop.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We've already done this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We have to get going.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
There is no candy!
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
No way.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
That's right.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
I got her arm.
We need padded chairs.
He is not cracking up.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
What? What's your point?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Stop.
Are we supposed to?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
What are you talking about?
Charles Moore for instants.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
How much?
Seating problems.
So what do we do?
Well I do.
The chairs.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Who's dead?
You're not breathing right?
Go for it.
Buzzing?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
A move?
That's a good one.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
...embarrassing, shameful...
Take me there.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Let me pass!
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Is she coming back?
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Mother?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
When you are, miss.
What?
From the terrace.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I've seen worse.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Think you can do it?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
How does he know who I am?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I am impressed.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
You know I am.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
How did you find out about the toxin?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
You okay?
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?

It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
<u>Do</u> it...
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who would find out?
...the... 
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?
...<u>nothing</u>...
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Eight Days To Go 
Anything at the Airport?

Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Wilfred.
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
Give'em another pill...
Courage, Mom.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
What's on your mind?
...why?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
...going to War...
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
Because.
"Freedom."
I saw it on TV.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Uh huh...why?
Why not?
Show Must Go On.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
All part of the Service we Render.

She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
You like it?
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...by you?
I'm just talking about the Hats.
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Just want to take a nap.
Oh, hell...
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...well, see him?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
What brings you out here...
Don't start, alright.
...thanks Natalie.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Oh no, no...
Jackson, Steinem...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
What? How do you know about my father?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
What makes you think you can?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
You really do believe in destiny?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
You told him about us?
He still likes you
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
We're all here, and ready sir!
Jenkins!
Hello?
No Jonathan.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Come on.
That's not what you said last night.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
I didn't want to come.
Do you have any idea who she is?
What?
How?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
I've seen you.  From the window.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
You are?
Seance.
Sit down here.
The planchette?
Jody, she's alive.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Something was there.  You saw it.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I know.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
What's their name?
I am, really.
Did she say that?
Hi.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You're kidding.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
It's a flare.
I didn't do that.
When?
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
You're not at the center.
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
I felt you...looking through me...
You don't remember?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
I may have seen her on campus.
The...
Claire--
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Oh God...
That's not what I'm sayi--
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
Who?
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
What's that for?
Mmmuh...
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Who the hel1 -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
You - are - a - murderer.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
It is from love.
A girl...?
I know that you're evil.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
I do not understand...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Hello...?
You know...?
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Wanna snack...?
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Wow...
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
OH MY GAWD!
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
This must be one of the old keys -
I'm sorry?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What is it?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
I thought it was you - how are you?
Dead?
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Finally, some gratitude.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
What do you want me to do?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
I understand.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Very funny.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
You're a peach.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Eventually you'll let go.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Maybe someday.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
But who would run the store?
I never figured you for a pimp.
I'm warning you.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
My father must've been amazing.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
And the child...
Try, Kelly.
No.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
What was that?
Why?
I want a full-scale investigation.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You didn't cuff her?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Ms. Toller?
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What are you looking at?
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Kelly.  What is it?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
I'm running away.
Forget it.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
We?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
That's a lot of butler.
Almost?
Now, what was that?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Jim, are you all right?
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
This is good.
No record of him.
Willard...
There's only seventy-eight.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
She's perfectly safe.
Your private train, sir.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
And?
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
You're not that big.
The first.
Easy now.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Willow Ufgood.
Yes...?
Because it's true.
Are you a warrior?
Fresh goat's milk.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
What do you want!
That's all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
Tir Asleen.
How??
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Queen Cherlindrea?
Ohhh, I hate this.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Cows. You know, cows?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
Are they going to kill you?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
It's all over, Paul.
Oh? Anything else?
Who are they?
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
But Stoltzfus said...
The... bullets?
You know carpentry?
What else can you do?
But... You may not be well enough.
Won him over just like that.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
I'm coming.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
I don't know where he is.
You didn't have to...
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Is the English dead?
No...
I don't want to stay here.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
This?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
...Toto, too?
Are you ready now?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Yes --
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Because I'm still scared!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Where's Kansas?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Leave her alone!
Oh, you did it yourself!
Yeah. Me?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
I haven't slept in weeks.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Mr. Gale!
...junk!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Stop that dog!
-- Ruined my exit!
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
You, of course. I need some information.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why?  What's the problem?
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
No idea who's behind this?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because --
Jon --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Who?
What??
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
What if you¹re wrong??
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What?
I think he's going to the john.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Where's Laurie?
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I can fix it.
I don't know their real names!
What about you?
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
Whatchu doing here?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Like what?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Hey, you're good.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Are you alright?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What are you doing?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Sit down.
Nice hops.
Why you dogging me up?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Into the Hudson?
What do you say?
He's uptight.
Logan, do you see this ring?
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Dr. Grey.
The intention of registration act -
I do love a good check mate.
What are you going to do?
Who?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Is it enough?
You have the wrong house.
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Give him an extra dollar.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Love me?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Is it worth taking a chance?
It seems fine.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Dr. Frankenstein?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
My father was a sick man.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Could be worse!
That's not bad.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Tonight?
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Can you play it?
What monster?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Inga, wake up!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Right here?
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
Yes...yes, you have yours.
His what??
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Foooooood!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
