Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What if she never starts dating?
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Dead at forty-one.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Sure
Away.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
You and Verona?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
That's never been proven
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know who The Raincoats are?
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Were you in jail?
No, you weren't
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Then you screwed up
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Tumescent!
That ' s what I thought
That's something you can't decide.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Island.  Far.
Thousands.
Ask him if he will help.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Give me absolution.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And what do you think Mendez?
Twenty eight.
We can't be.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
No.  No way.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
I will if they don't send me back.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'll make some for us.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Daphne, I...
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
It was my decision, not his.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Better than one.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
Is that all there is?
You wanna talk to her alone?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I kill someone famous.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
There are two bodies found at this point.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
And what do you do with the bones?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
You'll be my first.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Shut up.
Why not?
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Did you hurt her?
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Well, he...
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
A cheap hotel.
No way!  He's mine!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Yes, it is.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Whaddya mean, buy?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
That's never been one of my problems.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Not likely, convict.
Yeah.  Right.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Hello. And goodbye.
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
There's nothin' to talk about.
Yeah, I read the report...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
What'd you do?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Jack, wait...
Hi, it's me...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
So what?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
That's no bull.
Shut up.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
The case was stolen?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
...Ma???
Found it?
Got it...
I'll be right back.
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
What is it?
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You noticed..
Protect life... Until death.
...Like love...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Yes, Sir!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
I understand.
I know.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
... What's going on?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
You're killing me...
Tom... she's dead.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What are you talking about?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Fuck off.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Any good?
Who is this.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
How much did he pay you?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Never mind how I found you.
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You're asking me why?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Good for you.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Nothing remotely like this.
You're joking.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Okay.
I don't know.  I think so.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
It's been six years.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
We have matching luggage.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Oh God!  He killed them!
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Huh?
Been having bad dreams.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Sobering...
Very funny.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
My baby!
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Yeah...
I can't listen to this.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
The sound again?
I...don't know!
What???
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
What direction does the system indicate?
Who with?
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
- for horrors like yourself?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Wonderful!
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Shit.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I don't want to.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus, why?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Like hell.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
I'm fine, fine.
So?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Where's Jill?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
How's she doing?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
But not now.
Good.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Something about my father?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Twombley.
Huh?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Which is?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Yeah.
Well, I never heard that one.
I'm sorry, honey.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Got it.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
I'm doing what I can.
I prefered the terrorists.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
A secret service agent. It must be.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
No.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
One thing I've learned as
Hold on, Alice.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
White House Situation room.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
Other way around, sir.
Did we tape the Duke game?
That's my job.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Elaine, what's going on?
I guess this is a first for you.
Don't be too long.
Roger.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Scraps.
He's a boy dog.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
No. I'm all alone.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
That's right.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Yes?
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What is it?
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Here?
Do it!
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
And that fits?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Nothing.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
... It's Harcourt.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I'll bet.
What?
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
What?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
What about me?
You're really something, ace.
No, it's different, honey.
Yes.  A little girl.
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
His Grace is very angry with you.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Perhaps.
Don't bother!
What?
Sir -
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I want to go!
Where?
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
What?
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Stanzi!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
Then he didn't send you?
Oh, thank you, sir!
Alone.
But! I'm a married woman!
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Leave him alone!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Who was your teacher?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What do you mean, Sire?
Enchanted, Madame.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well. There it is.
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
It couldn't be better.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Not that I've seen.
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Animals?
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What for?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But what is it they don't like?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
I'm too young to be so sick.
He knows. He knows!
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
On the contrary.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
And do they believe it?
Do you believe it?
I poisoned his life.
Italian?
I've seen the manuscript.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Of course.
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
The American? Yes, duck.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Yes?
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
A doper werewolf.
I'm freezing.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
David, stop!
We had an argument. He's being silly.
No what?
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Yes.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Yes.
You're not having a good time are you?
Right.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Heathcliffe.
Come on, where?
Where are we going?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
What?!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Stop it, Jack.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
No.
I'd like some tea, please.
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Oh!
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Get out, get out!
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
What is?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Oh, yeah?
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
No.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I—
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
What'll we do?
Don't you think I know it?
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Oh, Matt.
Oh now, don't be silly.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Dude Finlay?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I'm okay, Matt.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
It's tougher than it looks.
Nope.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Hey!
Tell me.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
You're not scared, are you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Let's ride.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you too, cousin.
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Me get heap firewater --
Then why can't I go in there?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
You're doing just fine.
Maybe, maybe...
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
That he was.
A fair number, Ma.
Nuh-huh ...
What?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Last February?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
No.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Not at all.
Really!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Sir?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
I never knew you smoked.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody has a great body now.
You're inhuman.
I'm just leaving.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
You saw the ad in the Times?
There was no ad in the Times.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Patrick?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
Oh really? That's great.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Why?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Why would I?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Thanks.
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I'm hungry
Al.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Yes, it is.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They hack into people's programs?
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Prick.
He wasn't acting?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Gimme the coordinates?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Oh. Yeah.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Let's get him in here.
No. Please.
Why's that?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean -- break in?
Bring it to the other location.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
You're not listening.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Love is... love is... love is...
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Why?
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Shut up.
Austin, what's your point?
Oh, behave!
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.  Scott!
Please allow me to demonstrate.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
In due time.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Why?
No, he's really evil.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
No need. I'll call again.
Peter ...
You mean you don't recall??
Mr. John Steed, please.
Impossible?
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
After the cold war ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
How on earth can you tell?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
You didn't tell her?
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Surveillance? By whom?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Mother and Father know best.
Walk over to the window ...
But did they teach you this?
If you say so.
Ugh ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
What do you mean?
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Bond... James Bond.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Not interested.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
I'm very happy for you two.
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes I did.
No, Cole, I...
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Gonna get married...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
A real turd.
I think I screwed that one once.
What are you...
That's more like it.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
I didn't know you were into that.
What do you mean, it changes?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
You can tell a man by his friends.
So long, Father.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
What's this?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What's with her costume?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Yeah... too bright...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Saw what?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
You're back.
Really? No kidding.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Hey, do I know you?
Then who --
I don't have a story.
Trychticholorate.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
What are you listening to?
And the putty around the door?
But the right guess on this is arson.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Just wondering.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
He just wants to --
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He treats you okay?
You can't keep being his father...
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
I might.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Nah...
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
B-L-A-K it is.
Yeah!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Who are you revolting against?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
What do you do?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
How much?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I'm sorry I'm late.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Where do you go from here?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What do you want me to say?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Light?
Give me the gun.
He, I'm Mona.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
You feel good, not nervous?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Where is he?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...perfect...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Stop playing me Sloan.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
You can go now.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
And his baggage?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Have you had one?
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
How so?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
And he doesn't care about me?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you like then?
You did Basic here?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Sir, yes, sir!
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
My heart weeps.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Not for me.
What about the confession?
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Yes.
You made me look like an idiot --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You're off to a late start.
Got it.
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
Good, just making sure.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
What.
I used it to start the fire --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Yeah.
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
It's too neat.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
I don't expect to.
I brought it.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Eighteen.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How did you know?
I can get it. I can just...
I'll...
I know.
And I like you.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
How what happens?
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm robbing this place.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
That's because most of it never happened.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
So you never bought any land.
What for?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
There's over eighty thousand here.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
No. It's not that.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Sorry?
What's wrong?
They go.
You don't understand anything.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
I don't want to talk about him.
Oh Jesus.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Okay we won't talk about it.
Sometimes neither.
Please, there's no... Oh.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
I don't want anyone to die.
Maybe you will find out.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Yes?
Oh, she older than that.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Okay.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
For your hands?
You gonna miss your bus.
She's around. Always is.
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
You go to hell.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Itches.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Sure.
I ain't in a hurry.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Looks like you know a song.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Nuh-uh.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Why she got a chain on her?
Please don't tell my daddy.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You could put it that way.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Rae!
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Yeah, I do.
Ronnie...
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I just wanted some make-up.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Thought you had a man for that.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Thanks.
Let go...
Who do you think the Jap is?
In Rome, I'll bow.
Let's grab some food.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Connie...
I wasn't expecting you.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
There she is!
Are we getting married?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He's on duty.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
It is not allowed.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
If he won't cooperate?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Then go get him.
Would you like to be modified?
You're just all so... so different.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
This afternoon.
Tomorrow, he says.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
What was he after?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
I think we're through for the night.
Vodka!
I like you too.
I don't know.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
You sure?
Yes?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
I bet I would.
Of course not.
I'd kill it.
I'd never get an abortion.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
So?
Right.
Sit.
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Dead.
You mean a woman?
Uh-huh.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
What's up?
Go ahead.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Almost through.
Don't move.
What one?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
They left.
I was hoping you'd say that.
You scared me.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Are you French?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Perry?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
How long would you need me?
Sorry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
What for?
Why?!
Bites what?
The big one!
Sure.
It didn't used to be that way.
Sorry!
What?!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Uh...yeah.
Okay!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Look unimpressed.
I like her.
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
But, Eve, I would--
Yes, Eve?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
What's baseball?
Like a painting?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
No kidding!
Shit is a French word?
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
I promise. Is that all?
Yes, sir. It's true.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
It's so small.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
I just don't want to.
Goodbye.
My father is a genius.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Up there!!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
What?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I never know anymore.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Honey?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Buy it from me?
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Okay.
Why do you do it?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
Then don't talk about killing.
Don't say that.
Yeah, hurry up though.
No.
Falling.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I want you to hurt me.
You called me Jeffrey.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Bull.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Am I bothering you?
What else is new? Right?
That's too bad.
Maybe so.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know. He moved away.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
You've got a point there.
Yeah.
Brilliant.
Two.
OK.
Yes.
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Let's wait for some slow one.
No Jeffrey!!
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Look under the body.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
What happened?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Me, too.
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
You... oh god, why?
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
The what man?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
No. You sure you're okay?
Well, what'ya do?
Yes.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
OK. That's wrong.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
She's an attractive older woman.
Eight dollars.
Dignan! Stop!
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I keep it for emergencies.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Inez, this is --
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
They don't?
On the left.
That's a long time to be in jail.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Don't panic, Anthony.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Shut up!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I did.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Any activity?
It's going back down.
Careful. Check his pulse.
No. I'm not.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
How'd he do?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
There's a million places to hide around here.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Jesus Christ! No.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Let's cut the bullshit.
Good question.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
What the fuck possessed you?
See you in a little while.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Not bad.
I never agreed to that.
Bullshit.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Where's Applejack?
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Hand to hand combat?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Nice to meet you.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
It was staged?
Look at me.
I'm sorry.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
-- where's left to go? --
Switch! You drive!
There must be another way!
Tell me later.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
I want to hear it from you.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
So when was I here?
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
And why is that?
We must sue for peace.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
When will his trial be?
Hamish, I... thank...
I rest.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
How do you know this?
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.
Who would do such a thing?
What?
Why? What for?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
How soon?...
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Photos?
Damn. Your dad did this?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
I get it. You can drop it now.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Different? How?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Know what?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Evan Treborn.
Wow... read something.
Deal. Now read me something.
What's wrong with you?!
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Suppose we do.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Thank you very much. Good day.
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
When did you first find out he was alive?
I wish I didn't love you so much.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But Richard, no, I, I --
But what about us?
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Won't you join us?
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
How about New York?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
This is the end of the chase.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
What is your nationality?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
I don't want them here overnight.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Just a little something of my own.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Yes, boss.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Going to die anyway.
No.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Not if you work for FedEx.
For when I travel?
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
If I'd known you were alive --
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
And how was your Christmas?
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I know.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Where's Mandalay?
Oh, sure!
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
At least you were never lonely.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
It will be okay.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Nothing.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you know your mother better?
Really! Is it serious?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You still doin' it too fast!
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
I haven't read that.
Nobody's named this one yet.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
We heard that one already, Homer.
So what?
That's it.
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
When will he be home, Major?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
He ain't never been outta Maine!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Just the last three weeks.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
It's not true.
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
We'll use the Euc.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I can't do that.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
You get an equal cut.
Don't ruin this for me.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Escorts!
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Sorry. What?
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Pretty much.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Let's just say he burned me once.
Peace of mind.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Not like Matt, you mean.
What are you talking about?
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I'll try and make it.
Who was he?
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Probably.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
How can anyone be that naive?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
You know where I'm from?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
In the casino.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
It won't.
What about my neck?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Thank you.
Do you?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Who...
Thanks.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Give me 365.
Where's the magnet?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
It didn't go off.
Fuck that shit.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Any of 'em any good?
Veil nebula.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
We're running out of time, sir.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
What're you talkin' about?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
She was there...
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
A grand.
It's a rule.
They took my daughter.
I know.
Look, I'd really like to...
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
Whoever that is.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Is the social studies class over for today?
I'm not a half bad cook.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
We are not fine.
How well do you remember the lab?
How much do you know?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Your basic hodge-podge.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You believe that?
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Then what?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A little what?
Where?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Pull the cash.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Lydia.
I'm a toy to her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
--a philandering pig.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I was on call. 
Theo's dead.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Right, slow...
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Bye.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Damn straight we are.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
They're what?
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Neither do I!
GOOD MORNING!
Theoretically.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Take it off. I want to see you.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Where is she?
Why? Is this about the book?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
The good stuff.
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
What's her name?
Everything is going to be just fine.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
How did this happen?
Kitty...
Go back to China, bitch!
Raspberry.
She's right over there.
Really, Loretta?
Thank God for bunge cords.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Okay.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh-you-beccha.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
What?!
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
I know.
Are we on "Cops" again?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
That bitch from...
That's enough!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
He should be king!
"My dear President"...
Send for my car...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Half watch dog?
He only weighs ten ounces --
Did you shoot the rapids?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
What did you say to her?
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
$50?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Now -- er --
But -
I didn't come here to be insulted.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
Shut up!
Good morning, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Good! How is the patient?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I could easily arrange...
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Are you comfortable here?
I am very pleased to meet you.
What a mess.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
You're English.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yyyess.
My name is...
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Good morning.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
And the week before that?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
You're just saying that.
Really.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Yes... oh, yes...
Shut up.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Ah.
Louder.
Very deep... usually...
Don't you FEEL it?
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Well, come on!
To the oars!
Nobody gets killed.
No, don't say anything else!
What is it?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Mum! Dad!
What are you talking about?
What have you got there?
You could charge him what you like.
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Relax!
I'm drowning! Help!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You went berserk...
So did my father and his father before him.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Sh!
Dad!
Neither am I.
No... he's not... not... there...
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
No one.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
In the room?
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Rockville Center.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I can't remember.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I don't know what that means.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
I like to read.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I think so.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
Okay.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Joel, you're a liar.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Oh?
I'm right here.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I know.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
I think we should go.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I don't know.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
You must have been crazy.
Fuck you, Clementine.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
You love him, don't you?
I don't know! I just said that!
Can I... I brought some --
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
You made me have an abortion.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Yeah.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
You don't?
About...
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
It is not.
"Another man?" Who?
It gets worse.
What happened?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
Does he know that?
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Alive?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Negative.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
We don't have time to fart.
Now what?
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
What is it, Starck?
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
No. I'll be right back.
He served on the Goliath.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
They're explosive charges.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Victor's better at these things.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Ben. Are you okay?
I think that thing is Ben.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
It's been changed.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I gave him twenty.
Sure.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
How much did they cost?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
It's the first door on your left!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know what I look like.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I know it's yours.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Okay. See ya.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
I've been swimming, Merv.
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
All right.
I like sex.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Do you think that guy's cute?
Really?
He was hot, wasn't he?
I know.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What's the big deal?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I think they're both virgins.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
Not coming? What happened?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
That's the name they gave me.
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Well, you'll find out next year.
If you graduate.
I know, everyone says that.
No problem.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them.
Sure thing.
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Anything to drink?
Yes... It makes sense.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Really?
Las Vegas.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Lacerda?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
I have to go.
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
What tape?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
This is a fucking nightmare.
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We can't risk letting them in.
And the head?
Oh yeah?
Anyone else?
Sure.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Good.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What?
No shit.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Wait God-dammit!
GO-GO-GO!!
Right.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Are you lying to me?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
I'd like nothing better.
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm not!
I'm not!
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
In my eyes, officer.
Without me.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Really?
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
I didn't have much to do with it.
You really want to go?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Thank you.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh, Kurt!
Occupation?
What about your husband?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
What?
What happened to him?
What?
Eight stories.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Think I'll have a glass.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
What's that?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I don't know.
No.
Run!
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
...You will.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
I'll be back.
Sure.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Yes...?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Huh?
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Sedate her.
No!
How did you find me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
No. I draw the line.
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
I should go. I should leave today.
Fine.
The world is a dizzying place.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
I give you my soul...
It is
Open this door for no-one!
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Philosophical?
You disdain accepted wisdom?
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
The strain was evident.
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Okay.
Marcie?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
I can't, Barry...
For sure.
I'll spot you five points.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Whassamatta?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Another coincidence.
I said new, this is an '90.
Vamanos!
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where is the little lady?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Yes.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Pass.
He backed down.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Kate, Scott?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
-- you got your shower --
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
Sight seein'.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
No, I didn't.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This ain't the time.
We are?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
Thank you, ensign.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.
None at this time, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
West?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Did you hear?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
Do that.
Sir?
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Yeah.  Me too.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
You heard me.  Move on.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
I think you're the liar.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
I take it this file is still open.
Great. See ya then.
You made a mistake.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
It's good to see you, Nick.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Who is he?
So have dinner with me tonight.
Me too.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
That's right.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
Thanks.
Oh.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Open.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
"The show must go on."
Leadership....
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
You go first! There's no time!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
I played Richard III...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Okay, now. But-
What?  Up?
That's It?
We're getting major structural damage.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Covalent... Right. So...
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Nothing. Hold please.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Home.
Thanks
Then how did he find out about the device?
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
And determination.
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
What does she see in them?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
A lot of years have gone by.
Lafayette will not be happy...
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
They are... friends of Congress.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
General Lee is detained captain...
The British army, sir!
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A fleet?
I understand, George.
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
To win this war I need an army.
Some things must never change.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Africa, of course.
I reserved a Cadillac.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Who?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Yayo. Where is he?
You gave him the money?
Harry, let me answer that.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
That's all there is to it, huh?
What money?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I'm working on a few things.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
He owes me money.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Get him out've here.
Maybe a few times I have.
He drown?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Let's see how we get along.
Personally?
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you want to know.
I believe it.
Buddy?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
I'll find you, Leo...
Maybe you don't see my sign?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I know what a vig is.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Depends, who pays?
Really.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Murray's dead.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
I don't have a dog.
What money?
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Lemme see.
No.
Or uninvited guests.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Then what the hell happened to him?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
But how long?
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
How about you Epps?
Yeah, yeah.
Not in the eyes of the law.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
I don't know what you're talking about?
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Sorry.
Hell yeah.
You're a pal.
It's my pen name.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Yeah. Thanks.
She was sailing up north, right?
Who?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Epps.
If it was a ship she hit.
The what?
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Let the buyer beware.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
And look what happened.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
Fine with me.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
I guess.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
What are you trying to say?
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
So what do you think?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
You loser!
What does that even mean?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Oh, we totally have to.
What is this?
What are you talking about -- who?
I can't believe it!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Somewhere downtown.
Let's go hassle Josh.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Wait...
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
You're gross.  See that guy?
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
When was this?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
Norman.
You're late, asshole.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Well why do I care about that?
Indian records?
Okay.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I - I'd really rather not...
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
You work at Cook's Chicken?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Hi, it's me...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
YAAA!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Well when can we do something?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
I had to see you.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What do you want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Call me sometime.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Let me see the sick.
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Don't they, though?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
You never had it.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Somehow I guessed. 
Have you ever failed?
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Since his beard was red.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
How is he these days?
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
I'll supervise.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Thanks.
You're really good, you know.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I'm not even good for me.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
-- the sorrow --
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
You were the one who got me in.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Hello, Venkman.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Do it!  Just do it!
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Eight o'clock?
I got the Twister game for later ...
All right, what happened to me?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
I know.  It happened by itself.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Then leave.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
I see.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Well, that ought to do it.
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
You're coming back?
Send them out!
Do you want posters, too?
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
On what charge?
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
They fear me.
As soon as I can.
On my honor as your daddy...
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Well, they die for it!
Athenians...
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
No!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Before they leave, get gold.
I'd love some.
Why not?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Okay.
Yes.
I do.
That woman --
You mean the one who --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
Don't cry. 
I've never been to it.
Here? In Berkeley?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Well, I want you to leave.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
But you might.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Oh no. He said that.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
I'll be there in an hour.
Ahh -- thank you.
Where is your luggage?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
No. 
Please.
When is he coming back?
What?
Did you know that?
What's wrong?
What?
What do you think?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh my God.
Very well. Thank you.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Are you afraid of me?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What novel did you read.
There isn't any.
Calm down, Benjamin.
About five years.
Man, is this interesting.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Yes.
We'd go to his car.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
You're not.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Of course you did.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Where is Elaine?
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
When I go off?
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
I do.
We haven't.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Swell. I appreciate it.
What?
Thank you.
Oh yes.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Yes?
Yes, I can.
Not now.
Have you got that skeleton key?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No --
No -- why? -- should I?
Aren't you?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Am I quite strange to you?
No.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
Oh -- 
I don't want them now.
So --
I'll go -- good-bye.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I thought she was splendid!
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Don't do that. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You are ill.
What, Doctor?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Oh -- you would!
Really?
Preysing?
You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Do you like me better?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
...weight into the balance...
Nothing.
Yes --
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
What a session this has been.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
What you need is some relaxation.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
I certainly hope not.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
You brought a case? Good.
What? He's going to be all right!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
I know.
I'll get you a check.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
So I heard.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Bluebell came in?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
No. That was the point.
You, too, Roy.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
As though you do what I say.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
What?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
That's right.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Let's find out.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I'll see you when you get home.
Nobody does that single-o.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Upstate.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
I saw her.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
Not many.
No question, huh?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
I like a woman who takes control.
Detective...
Funny, we just drove right in.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
And miss the big game?  No way.
My office?
You're so predictable.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Just forget it...
I was trying to get away from someone.
Get on the bus.
John, you can't help her now.
I can't afford to get caught.
Can I come in?
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
Shit happens.
Yeah.
Very insightful.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
You've been watching too much TV.
Danny!!!
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
He's gone.
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
At least we found the diamonds.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Haven't got one.
Let's talk about something else.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
You.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Is Penelope in?
For what?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
As a matter of fact--
Are you--
I'll see.
She met him at college.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
What's good about that?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Wow.
Uck.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Can't it keep till morning?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What's this?
What time do you get off work, my child?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Your old beau?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If he thinks he's man enough.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
Where's the bullet?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You've killed women?
Oh dear.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Pacqualinincheewa root.
I've never heard of it.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
Was I ever of use?
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
I've enjoyed being man.
Leave the rifle here.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
For what?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Premature ejaculation.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
A what kind of doctor?
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
He can hardly talk.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Don't worry about it.
It's fine!
No!
He'd assume we had.
Yeah.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
The what?
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
But is she, has...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Yeah.
That's cool.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
What's that shade of blue called?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
At least I'm a growing person.
Say what?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
No.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
They were here?
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
That's right.
What are you paying me for?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Like what?
What?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
You're talking about real excitement?
Ratan!
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
It's an investment.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
To his own daughter?
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Out!
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
We planted it.
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
What kind of a car is it?
Well then.
All right.
My door is always open.
Me! No. Of course not.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Yes. Very much.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Why not?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Yes.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Yodeling?
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
What is it, Harold?
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
She took my head.
Why?
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I don't care what people say.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
A rough estimate.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Jeez! That's a great story,
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Who?
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
You mean, outside... with her.
Red, I found something --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
No. It was red. Bright red.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Who?!
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Oh, sod you.
Want to buy a bed?
Where's my father?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
No.
Come to Daddy.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Oh my God.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What do you want me to do.
What?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
What kind of doors?
You're still afraid.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
Don't you care?
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Oh my God.
You mean we're moving in?
In here.
Shit.
Larry....
O.K.
Not much.
Plain soda?
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No personal details?
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
You will keep in touch.
Take care, Dad.
Is Julia here?
Kirsty.
I've forgotten.
Steve?
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I have to get out.
Oh no.
Are you alright ?
If I make it through the day.
It's a fetish of mine.
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Will you GO, damn you?
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Not the point.
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
None.  Christ!
Fuck off, Barry.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Huh?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Are you coming home?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Is it better?
I haven't felt like it.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
You do, huh.
You don't ever think about other people?
You know what I mean.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
It'll have to be sex, then.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
No, but...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
I'm alright.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Well, you've asked.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
It's a crematorium.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
I understand completely.
You haven't even seen it!
I'm sure it isn't.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
That way.  You?
So so.  Up and down.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
Fine.
No, we...
Records are those big round black things, right?
What's the name of your label?
How old is Richard?
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Anything in Maryland is close.
It's not mine.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
That bothers you?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Not all of them.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
What is it you want?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
-Luceat ei-
Your marks would suggest great injury.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
It was time for our paths to cross.
I don't know why.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You will live.  Survive.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
But we cannot be killed.
How can I stop such a man?
What would you like?
Tradition.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
Equals?
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
Yes, he was.
Figure she's with him?
What name is he using?
And the Bulgarian?
You were never a kid.
Not so long.
As you wish.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Leave her alone.
American.
A mystery.
All I need is time.
The resemblance is amazing.
No.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Fine.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
I see what you mean.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
So long.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
What home?
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
No, I can't.
You've had a better offer, eh?
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
You -- you --
What's the matter?
No!
Bermuda.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
You said it.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
How much do you want on it?
Where's some paper?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
You been in a fight?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
You said it!
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
What have you got, Hildy?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Good coffee, isn't it?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
What?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Go on -- shoot me!
You'll take fifty and like it!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Come on with that money!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
That man there!
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Get the Governor on the phone!
The what?
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
Hello, Mollie.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
What's that?
I only know one.
OK. You're in.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
It's easy. I've done it.
That's not the point.
Well, for the baby, really.
It's like telling fibs.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
I don't know?
You need trees for an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
It looks....foreign.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Grace!
Play something, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
How long?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Nice.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Really fucking awesome.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
He won't move.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
How's he get around out here?
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Keys.
Firefly.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
Oh, you mean on TV.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
What should I do?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That must be him.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
That would be good.
Yes. Happy happy.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Fine.
Urgh.
I just want to talk.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
No. You look so beautiful.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
We still have you and I.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Okay.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Be still my crotch.
Where?
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Oh, and the sun block?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
Oh boy!
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Okay. That's fair.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Do we need words?
Thank you.
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
What did he say?
Character.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
How're the hands?
They're fine.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Half.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I don't want it.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Okay?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Try me.
Okay.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
What?
What bus?
Thanks. I will.
Then why go to the bus station?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Give me a drag.
You want to go with me?
Eggs. How do you like them?
Me. It's Eddie.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
No. You?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Does it bother you? What he said?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Just for luck.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Thousand dollars a game.
My wife.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner, I --
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Where, Jimmy?
But it's not, Jimmy.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
Why, yes.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
Better be. You left me for him.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
A countdown to what?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Just getting a feel for her.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
It's doing what?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Jimmy, stay with me.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Yes.
Air... water... your "sun."
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
All your life.
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
That was our assessment as well.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You could be more right than you know.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
I usually don't.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
I said don't go between them!
No?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
So it did.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Out!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Umh?
How did you she was a Nazi?
So did I.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
And the chair.
Head for the fireplace!
I'll take the camels.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
And why were you trying to kill me?
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
You should have been there...
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
A snake!
A SNAKE!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
That's good -- you're doing fine.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Maybe...
What does the writing say?
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
A what?!
I'm going down.
What above the curves?!
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What for?
I'm...inside you.
What's going on?
Don't do that.
...I need to make a phone call.
My place, can't you see?
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I just went there for a job.
Yep.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
With a man in my head...
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
I am. You are.
Black suits and helmets.
I'm at the airport.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
What am I supposed to do?
What about it?
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Little late for that.
I don't want to eat it.
Which language?
It worked.
What glasses.
She's the toughest to read.
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
It wasn't like that.
Why don't you get out of my face.
Osaka?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Run, stupid!
I told you, I have a feeling...
Drink lots of water.
Where?
And Dieter?
I can't handle that thing.
Aim what?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Keep thinking.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Oh no!
Do what? What'd you do?
Don't worry.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
In him?
It is to me too.
It may have been affected.
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
I feel fine.
What?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Not you. Them.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
A little voice in my head.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
The poet...something he said...
Without what?
Who do you work for?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You did.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
We're very close.
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
I love you too.
Escape.
Her?
We just don't stop.
He told me what to do.
I told you, I work for him.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Yes.
So we better get started.
Instant rice...?
I heard them.
Where?
Yeah.
Yes, baby?
Three hours.
Push it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Alright, alright.
Sure.
Good.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
You ready...?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
I have to take a shower.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Alright.
Alright?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Like what? Your sign?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I'll call them, Lowell.
No? No, what?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Most certainly.
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Sustained.
What the hell is Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
Set one side for Bel Air.
What?
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
So, that's good, right?
No.
Why do you think she did it?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No.
What is it Miles?
I want... I want to...
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Oh Miles!
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin.
Please!
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
She did a Harriman.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
That's delusional.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Oh brother. Here we go.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
But then... But then...
I don't know. I can assume...
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
She owes me a meal.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Three is not Farrow.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, hello, Dad.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Nothing. 
Who is he?
Oh, come now—
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Yes, sir.
No.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
You're on a budget from now on.
Your ego is colossal.
Not at all. 
Outside!
I can't go out like this.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Nope. No complaints.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
You're crazy.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
You're prejudiced.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
What?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Raw?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
What'd you give him for the car?
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I'm out! I'm out!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
You bet we did.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
Yeah!
Yeah? Where?
Thanks.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
What!
Huh?
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
Okay, pete. 
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Thanks, Joe.
What?
Collect?
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yes, Ma.
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
Yeah—wouldn't it?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Did he pay?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
No, I'm not...
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
I had the cause of death.
Hi, Freckle Face.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Four to six.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I wouldn't imagine where.
A Perry Russo?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Warren Commission call him?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did. 
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
If you buy what you read in the paper.
And Oswald?
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Do you walk home?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
I understand.
Who was there for your ass?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Go ahead.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
She almost sounds scared.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
What time do you have to be there?
I'm not saying another word.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
What's her name?
Okay.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Was she helpful?
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He came by.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Catching a movie.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Right around here, in the food court.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
More or less.
Which one?
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him you want to see him?
What's he doing?
I know.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Madrid or Barcelona?
If I don't cooperate?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
A Broadway shopping bag.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
It looks good on you.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Baby, I didn't --
I do okay.
How the fuck they know that?
They already know it's you.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Managers get ten percent.
Uh-huh.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
The roller disco one.
Were you a disco girl?
You lived in Japan, when?
Must of made quite an impression.
Does that bother you?
Uh-huh?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Lemme have the bag.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Who was Beaumont?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
So we on the same page then?
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
Sure.
Yep.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Not now, pick me up.
You couldn't just hit her?
You shot her twice?
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
We went to the parking lot.
Tell me.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Have fun.
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
You think you could do that?
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
I can see that. Why?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Hear what?
Did the police contact you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Was she?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Is that what I think it is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She's all alone.
Yes.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
I'm okay.
How do you know?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
That's right. We did.
What do you mean?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I'm too messed up to teach.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What else did he say, Jake?
He told me he was going to Hell.
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
She talk about the boys?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
What do you mean?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
I must have been out of my head.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
I enjoy crushing into you.
When was the last time I said a word?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Where have they gone?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
Like it was yesterday.
What is it?
One drop?
What?!
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Everywhere, like a plague.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Punk?
Alright, asshole.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
I don't know. Nothing.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Cool.
The hull's imploding!
They're back here.
Let's move out!
Thorgan? You coming?!
You're a teacher.
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
My job.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Not so bad.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
We're screwed.
I'm on my way.
He was chasing me!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Thank you.
That ought'a help the situation.
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Sory...
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
But?!!
But...I...400 years?
I didn't say he was alive.
Get him out of there!
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Sure but what good will that do?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
You going to be all right?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Think the tide's with us?
You from around here?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Down here, Hooper!
I'm okay...
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Is that normal?
Oh. That's a relief.
I don't like Katrina.
What, you mean as friends?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What a trip, man.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
What? My eyes are not lying!
Shut up.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
You know... it's parts...
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Is Vanessa here?
I actually know this one.
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
You're pregnant?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Please stop now.
I am a suicide risk.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Share the love, Tits!
What?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What do you make with that?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Looks like it, yeah.
Carrie.
Is it hard to learn?
You can?
Took 'em all.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
What's Early been in jail for?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
...I don't know.
Vernon, Florida.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Damn right I do.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
I heard that.
Take your time.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
I'm finished.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Shut your mouth.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
What is it?
Yes!
Was up bitch?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
He lives on 76th?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Unzip my pack, yo.
Right.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Darcy?
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Bet.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
You are?
Why not? You stink.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Nothen' B.
You goin'?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Come on.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Of course I do.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Thanks.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
You are being ripped open.
I didn't bleed.
No, I didn't bleed.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Oh god. That's horrible.
What?!
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What kind of problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Get off me!
Local?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
But a hundred men could move him.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
What makes you think I was there?
Very good.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Boys.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Nothing.
Any sign of rape?
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
You mean, no prints but hers?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Answer the question.
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Are you one of the players?
When I was very young.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
No you didn't.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You're not?
No.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I thought you said the line was busy?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Because I know what it says.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
Do we have a future?
About what?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I won't leave you here.
You won't have to.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
I'm not sure.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
He has come for Lyssa.
The Beast will kill her.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Each to his fate.
Even by you?
Yes.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
A flicker of talent.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
I don't think it's working.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
And do you think I live on air?
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Oh, my poor stomach.
Hush!
Look at its insides.
Freylag's stronghold?
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
You know the voice.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
That is true.
Ynyr!
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
Of what?
No.
Why do you want to know?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Yes, yes...
No, you can't go out.
What?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
A little...
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
I love you so much, Leon.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Mathilda, listen!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
No it's not.
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Pardon?
I've seen it before.
You have?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
What?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Yes.
Please tell me.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
Where?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Not our problem.
That's me.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
By car right?
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Where?
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
She never ate a slice.
You're amazing.
I do.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Evening News?
What are my choices?
Water?
Water.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Well... OK...
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
When?
Oh, and what did you do?
Yeah... I'd like that.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
How much, do you think?
With an old friend.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
But it's a top three school --
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
Tell him, Paulette.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
So everything you just said --
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
I don't know.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
What?!
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
I wasn't gonna --
She's completely untrustworthy.
No, she can't move for an hour.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you sure?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
That's not entirely --
What, like it's that hard?
Now I am.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
What do you want with me?
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Do it now!
Oh, yes...
I see...
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
To be sure.
What!
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Ogg's footprints!
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
There must be some way to get it up there.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
It doesn't matter.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
If you like.
Sport, indeed.
I detest serpents.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Only what's right...
What?
Lili... I love you!
And I love you, my husband.
I can't see a thing.
Thought the weather terrible of late.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Exceeding fair.
I don't believe you.
Do I not please you, Jack?
In every way.
That was in jest.
You... you... you mortal you!
Please...
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
I think she's about to foal.
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Red.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
I'm living here while I build another house.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Hi.
He jumped into the ocean.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
He's at work while I'm here.
No.
Oh, yes.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
how much weight have you lost?
He buys and sells the world.
How old are you?
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
What can I do for you, George?
I'll ask.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I'll hate you forever.
No.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
I don't know.
Did you got through my pants?
No.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
That's so weird...
Are you taking them still?
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
God, you look like crap, George.
Three.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
I drove over and you were gone.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
The first and the last.
What have you been before today?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Finished or unfinished?
I smiled at him.
I'd rather you not be here.
Going on?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You got the money?
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
His father is a man.
Should I?
Sam took them to a movie.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Hey.
I didn't go in your room.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
No, nigger.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Not for me, it ain't.
Is Spanky here?
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Here!
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
I don't think so.
You went to Monroe?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
What gave you that idea?
Still got that ten dollars?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
I'm sure it don't.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Does that mean I'm in?
What'd you say?
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Crawfords.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I said you're soft.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Yeah? You and what army?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
He must still be in there.
It'll be too late.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
They run but they never get too far.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
Let her go.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
...their damned souls will be ours.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Noon...
Try an angel.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Everything's fine, pop.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
So I followed him...
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You think I'm a tourist?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
It'll be all right...
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
I'm in my party mood.
Anybody we know?
Why did you do that???!!!
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Sad? What made you sad?
No.
And now?
All right.
Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.
I wish I could help you.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
They won't believe us.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
All right.
Alive?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
This is our bedroom.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
No. Fred hates them.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
I don't know.
Yeah. Call him.
Yes.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
The police called us.
No.
Yes.
His physical condition.
We'll get a tail put on him.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
Nothin'.
I don't know yet.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
Wake me up when you get home.
Just a minute.
What job?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Pornos?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Oh, really?
Yes.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Just call me Barney.
Huh?
No.
Why, you look beautiful.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Leaving?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
You have no disputes over women?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Then it's done.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Mine?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Right, Bob.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Is that all my story meant to you?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Yes, everything!
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Yes.
Struggling, why?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
The hell were you thinking?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Sir--
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Gee.  You really think?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
in case I need it?
There wasn't time, sport!
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Why not?
You're not taking me in!
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I dunno. One?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Will it lower the curve?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
This guy.  Where was he?
Scientific American?  Really?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Forget that guy --
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
What is it?
Anderton --
Someplace safe.
Why?
She grew up.
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
Whatever you say, John.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
Yes, you did.
They were performance pieces.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
No doubt.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
I show a cop on horseback.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
The mall?
Did Marks close the front door?!
Go back to work.  All of you.
That was easy.
Yes, it is.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Tell me how.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
I forgive you.
Who said I would?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You say some of the children died?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I don't know who that is.
We know why John was tagged.
I'll be right there.
Wait, just a second...
Right here.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
Sure.  Raincheck.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
What's 'incidentals?'
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
So?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
We're in Fashion.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
It's daytime.
No.
Chloe?
I feel weird asking him.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Get your hands off of her.
Your dance is over.
Yeah, sure.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Yeah.
Get away from her.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Yeah.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I'll work it off.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah.
He'll work it off.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
Nah.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
What about it?
What are you saying?
Yeah. I know the number.
Bye.
He implied it.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
I like it.
Who's driving her?
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
What the fuck do you...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
You got that right.
Fine.
We're getting whacked.
Did you hear what he just said?
We don't need guns.
No.
What about it?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I'll be a minute.
I didn't do anything --
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Drinks are free, right?
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
No, really, mate?
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Word.
Keys.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I sure met some.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
No, Brother Minister.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
You have enough worries of your own.
I know.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm tired of praying.
Let's get out of this cold.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
And like a fool I believe it.
'Bout every other night, Red.
With him?
I mean it's late, baby.
Murder.
You're my father.
And don't come back.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
It's a little late.
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Creasy...
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
No, that was in Columbia.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear.
You're American.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
For an American she understands this country very well.
I'm trying, mom.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
What? Who?
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Where?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
You want me to ride down with you?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Your son Marty?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Sure.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Tomatoes.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
What, Ma?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
This is a good deal here, Marty.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
On accounta...
Sure, sure.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Never this close.
How you, Radar?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Home.
Where?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
What's that?
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
An eternal damnation.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't have much choice.
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Yes, dammit, and...
Sir?
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Hello.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
What John Doe?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
What bonus?
Oh!
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Yeh.
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Huh? Get what?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Oh!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
That's too bad.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
Yeah.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
I don't know.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
You can't help me, man.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
I need to get something straight first.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
I what?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Only at the very end.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
We see each other every couple of months.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
Fine.
Damnit!
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Scottie...
It's okay. We broke up.
Use your imagination.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Scott...
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
Depends. What's up?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Define concern.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Yes.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
From the dream.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
And down here --
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Then where is she?
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- The inside?
It was a test.
Realize?
Sorry?!
Because you'll never believe me.
Just like that?
Stylin'!
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
Where did it originate?
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
There's enough for everybody!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
What's going on?!
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Life knocked me back.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Who hired the bastard?
Long as Charlie says.
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
For being a bootlegger?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
But there's...
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
What's your problem?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
So tell me when I ain't done it.
But that's an hour's drive.
Don, I'd be honored.
I've got friends.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
Okay. I'm listening.
The Big Picture.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Switch hands.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Can't you give it to me later?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
What happened?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
... Oh ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I did not--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
What's this, Diz?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
That's taking place outside now.
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
What?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Susan? Nah!
Right now--everything I own--!
That infernal phone!
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Now, pet--  Jim!
We're waiting, Hubert.
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Oh! Go away.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Ah, now, that's better.
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Mr. President--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
You're a liar!
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Convene?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes, I see that.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Have you always had to--work?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
It *is* not!
No!
No--
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Saunders--!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
That's--that's splendid.
Well! You don't say!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
How's that, buddy?
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Let's get away from here. 
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Well, well!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Nice *compliment*!
He did it.
What do you think?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Do I actually *see* this--?
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Never can tell what he's going to do.
No! I resigned last week!
But they did take place?
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Yes!!!
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Huh?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What did you mean by that?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
You have?
He did? I play the tuba—
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Mary - I - excuse me—
Oh, hello darling.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Yeah, then what?
The guy's balmy.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Hello.
With pay!
Is he really that big a sap?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Hello . . .
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yes.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
See you later, kid.
Where?
All set.
All right.
Are your parents living?
Who - me? No.
What for?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Huh?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Yes?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
I just wanted to make sure.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
You try it.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
How do you mean?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
No?
Go to hell.
I didn't hear you.
You are so mean.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Oh?
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Is she a friend of yours?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Something's bothering her.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
No.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
And he's where?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Sofie...
You probably got the idea.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
That's not quite what I said --
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
Nah... scotch.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Don't you like this?
Well, there's Lily.
Amazing.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
I can tell you anything else.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Things got a lot worse.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
That'd be Lily.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Immune from what?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Yeah! Them.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
To be hanged.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
I know my treasure.
The things that get you excited.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
FINE.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
I have no choice.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
That just makes you more gullible.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
You have got to be joking?
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
One last tweak.
Do it, big boy!
The Inscrutable Six?
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
How's your dad?
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Think positive.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
What about Captain Amazing?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
It's home.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Monica, where are you?
I just know.
And you are a fool.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
See ya tomorrow.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Yes.
The Eradicators!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
But how do we get in?
May the forks be with us!
Right.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Where are they?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
But who made this treaty?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
You may go, Captain Charles.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Oh -- where do you come from?
No, they're living in Nice now.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I see.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Junot?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Well, you shall see.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
And now?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
I cannot promise you that.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Why not?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
That's all I can say.
Yes.
Yes, I wrote it.
My God, what do you think?
Yes?
Yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Send him in.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
And I can go free?
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
Naw, I already ate.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
What's the B-G's?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Peace out, Craig.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
I don't have no damn cover.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
He's a boy, dude.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Rancho Cucamonga?
What?
Huh?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Shut yo' ass up.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Who, him? Just visiting.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
That's right.
What the hell are you saying?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Me?
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I think you're right.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
How did you see us kiss?
Let' s do it.
Keep it.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Please...
What?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Fuck you!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Everybody does?
A surprise?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Where?
Do it!
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Yes, Dad.
Not even her?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
When'll the skiff be ready?
Don't!
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
So you ain't with the State no more?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Pearl dotes on him.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Why?
Hm?
John! Don't!
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Up river.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
I'll tell.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
You could save him, little bird.
Mm-hm.
How old are you?
What's your name?
Because John said I mustn't.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
How'do.
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What you been up to?
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
You believe in anything?
What happens if they don't do that?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Great.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Okay. Hi, dad.
You know he's dead though, right?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
School.
Right home after. See you.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
You were screaming like crazy.
The door was locked from your side.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
He's nuts about you.
Jungle man fix Jane.
It's from Paris.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Well, a hat...
And there?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
I can tell you exactly.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
No, no.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Certainly.
Thank you, Louis.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What did she say about me?
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Comrade Kopalski...
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Private.
Confess what?
Oh no. No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Thank you.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Suppress it.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
And what is your profession?
That is correct.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Will you smile?
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I wish they had never met.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I don't think so.
Anything, Ninotchka.
I don't think so.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Who cried that one?
So happy and so tired.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Now, Swana...
What does he say?
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
How do you do?
Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
No thanks, Swana.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Yes.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
She's gone, Leon.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Thank you.
I don't understand.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
You did say it, sir.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Uh huh ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
How so?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Mitchell?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
'Night, Al.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Cox!  Fire him.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Fucking hell.
We were working on China.
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
All right.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Jesus!
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Sir?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What about happiness, Mother?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Mr. Castro.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Who do you think is behind it?
Kissinger?
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
The White House.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hello ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Sir?
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
Proud?
It's hard to lose ...
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
Amen to that.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Yeah ... I'm out.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
This.  Above all.
No.
They were for me.  They're mine.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Someday, Dick.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Some say you are, Rocky.
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
You don't know what he thinks.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
No I ain't.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
I don't know...
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
That's very nice.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No. But I gave my word.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Goin' where?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Llewelyn --
Promise?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
What did you tell him?
Why would I let you do that?
What's that.
I can't say.
Is Llewelyn there?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
No me mate.
You know who it is.
All right.
This. And the gas.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
For what?
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
No.
How's that?
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
That's twenty-six dollars.
No sir, it's unusual.
What room?
How well do you know Chigurh.
That's not an answer.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I do like you.
Not any way.
No. You don't understand.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
"Banners?"
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
...what're you saying?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yes, ma'am.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
The LeSabre!
Yeah, me too.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Do what?
Yes, she is.
Of course.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Uh-huh.
It was Chloe...
You're in serious danger!
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Worse.
I married a car salesman.
You're hurting him!!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
What? Where was he?!
...okay.
He is real.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
If we're for real?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I don't follow...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Should I kill him now?
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
It just didn't fit her profile...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I'll think about it.
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Sure.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
David Ravell.
Did Chloe crack?
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Her show?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Mr. Campbell?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Huh?!
Good Lord, what do we do?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Oh, okay.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
That's good, honey.
That's not my ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
I am. Hur you?
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Buyin' nipples!
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
A long time ago.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Why? Because you can do it alone?
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Yes, sir!
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Then, I'll see you around.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Great.
Everything was different.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
No way... Would you?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Seriously.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I'll get it if you want.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Your real father?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why'd he do it?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Remember that.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
And we're never getting in.
No, you can't come in.
No ball, kid.
Not at all.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
No fucking way.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Open the door.
Well, I know that now.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Nope.
I don't know, why?
I saw something, I saw...
He WILL.
Huh uh.
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah.
I got you.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
What's with you?
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
What are you saying?
Bullshit...
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
No, he takes after his mother...
He's my father.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Are you going to meet with him?
I understand, sir.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Is that so?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
Pride is his weakness.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
Cheraw Falls.
She is.  Don't go in there.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Yes.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
When?
How many men have we seen die?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Worse.
Well...I guess not.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Yaay!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Well, I thought it was safe--
To remember.
I know.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What were you listening to?
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You keep saying that.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
And because the dead walked.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
I got eggs down here!
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I will.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
He didn't waste it.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Can I trust you?
Will -- you can't trust him.
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
That we are.
Smith.
I said, no lies.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Where does it make berth?
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
It's still against the law.
My father.  William Turner?
I swear, you look just like him.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
A moment.
Please.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
It's ready now, I know it is.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Do you think she loves him?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
The nanobot is gone.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Shut up and do it!
I like Trix!
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What did he want?
The replicators?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Been out for six months now.
You're insane.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
We don't?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
The waste.
What do these replicators do to people?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
The nanobot... it's not here...
What did you want my hair for?
That's going to fit me?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
Yes.
I have to!
I remember I was trying to help...
I guess they do.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Exactly.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For what?
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Now let's get this settled—
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
I poisoned him.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Good morning. What does this mean?
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Is that so?
Huh?
Oh yeah?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Right - for the first time this year.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
—and those and them.
Well!
Not since you broke into society.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Have you seen this? 
I beg your pardon?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
The name is Smythe.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Yeah.
No, sir.
That's all I wanted to know!
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I had to say goodbye.
Here's my favorite.
Oh yeah.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
You want to get out of here?
What?
Rain.
Still doesn't make it right.
Well--it was dark out ...
You're not allowed to lie.
What is it?
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
I'm not sure.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
What?
What were you doing in a library?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
Nothing.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
You don't know?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
I'm not sure.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Where are you going ...
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Re-runs?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Why?
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Listen to me!
Have you cooked the burgers?
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Well here I am.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
What's the listing?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
That's your fault not mine.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Did I say that?
No.
It's fine, but --
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
I have no idea.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
They don't get opened until eight.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
I saw a picture of you.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Really?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah, no, I see --
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
...I don't know what you mean....
About six months ago. Why?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
It's ok to ask that.
I thought that you were anyway.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok, bye, bye.
No.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I didn't do it.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
Barry Egan.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
Fine, thank you.
....yes.....
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Where you goin?
Ok.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Alright, alright.
Yes. Sorry.
You can't be late.
What's the problem?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
It's fine.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
Mustn't do that, sir.
Don't be so sure.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
THEN BUGGER ME!
A man after my own heart...
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
What on earth would that require?
NOW STRIP.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
He's sworn to obedience.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Is it awfully violent?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What thought is that?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
Oh, but I am!
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Last week would this be?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Uh-huh
So I've been told.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
This picture--
There is nothing to discuss-
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Sir?
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Huh?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Forget it-
Telling stories.
Not for me.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Right-
But with compassion and insight--
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
And what does he see?
Craig is one syllable
I don't give a shit about-
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Hedy Lamarr?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
This ain't George's doing--!
Again.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Then find another theater
I really think you're
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Yeah.
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
It's not done.
Nothing...
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Sure. What is it?
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Go 'head.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
With her? How?
You want the title shot?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
But you said "you."
What?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Yeah. At night.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Come here.
Now take your panties off.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You asleep?
Yeah.
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
With Salvy, eh?
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
I dunno.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
He should.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
His wife took a trip.
She never left the apartment --
Who left -- where?
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Ever get an answer?
That depends on who "they" were.
Like an old hambone?
Wrong day?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Who are you?
Tell her to bring it back!
Is what you want something you can discuss?
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
You called the police?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
You haven't even heard from him?
And your stomach?
I wish there was one I wanted.
Lisa! Shut up!
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Someone not his wife?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I do?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Give me some dirt.
Chicken?
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Okay.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
How'd he get in?
Any other entrance?
I better clean this up before she sees it.
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Yes, sir.
I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Judy.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
We'll take it!
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
That's a fine way to behave!
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
Mess that kid up?
So then you moved?
But you don't think that's a solution.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Now that's true!
Who lives?
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Why?
You don't need to do that.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
What's he like?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
My mother?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
No.  Why?
Must have a way with stationery.
What are you doing here?!
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
NO!
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
We sell children's toys --
No, no --
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
Tell me again.
I'll see what I can do.
Nick...
You're in on this.
No!
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm almost done.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
I shared his cell!
So you could get with my sister.
Her brother.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
You do.
At least gimme video poker.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
You need six.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Ash?
GO!!!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Haven't thought about it.
And some pecan pie.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
GUARD!!!
She set them up. All of them.
How'd you know I'd do it.
There is no other table --
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
How is he?
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Why?
You didn't ask.
Correct.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
You really think we were set up?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
That was the plan, we meet here.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
If we don't, he'll die.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
And one of 'em is sick.
You can't leave us here.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
The who?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
I suppose that's my fault.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Hurry up.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
At the ranch maybe?
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
There's only two of them now.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
Sure. What other reason would there be?
You'll live.
I can't take her with me.
What's there to be fair about?
There aren't any women here.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
What for?
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Don't you even know your letters?
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Then I know my alphabet.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Sure.
Thanks, Steve.
Wife?!
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Okay.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Yes...
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
So, whatever happened to her?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Both of them?
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Just wait, you'll see.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Hey, I got an idea.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Saw who?!
Are these all the subjects?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
In about fifteen minutes.
Right. What about condoms?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
What?
Just a little experiment.
Just a little Rogaine.
Thanks, handyman.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
What?
My holy water.
Get out?! What does it say?
Don't worry, I got your back.
Mother? 
Is MOM... in there?
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Thanks, Mom.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
Looks good, Mom!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Yes... but... I didn't...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
What's he know?
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Yeah —- sure.
Yes.
No.
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
"The Dante?"
And that was all?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
We could tell him.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I don't think that's so revealing.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
They may have been friends of hers.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
I'd like that.
Cloven hoof?
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No, she's with her sister,
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I don't believe it.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
It won't hurt.
Yes?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
You mean like "time flies"?
Thank you.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
Videotapes.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Maybe you want to go.
Don't you want to make one?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
I have money.
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Why?
Can't or won't?
So you have had sex.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
I'm not in love with you.
No.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Possibly.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Are you having an affair?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Why don't I believe you?
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Yes.
No, I didn't.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Is he still at your house?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Why?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Then why'd you call me?
But why did you want to?
It looks like a tablecloth.
Okay.
It was busy.
Doing what?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Cynthia. John.
I like the way he dresses.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Right.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Student?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
John Millaney.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Yes.
You knew these people?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
No. I don't think so.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
SPONSOR!!!
...closed?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
What do you mean?
No...couldn't I do this later?
Me?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
F for...
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
It'll just take a second.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Bye.
How's the trip?
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
So I guess that's it.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Glass or bottle?
You got it.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
You said you had it all lined up.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Um... seventy... something.
And Lexapro, yes.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
What do you think?
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Right now.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Slaughterhouse.
What?
Let's leave it alone.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
I don't have to.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Keep it elevated.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I finished it.
Try it.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Victoria.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
About four weeks.
French or American?
Both.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Oops. Sorry.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Who said I was going to die?
Yes.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
They already know we're here.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
What's two?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Yeah.
There's nobody coming?
Sounds good.
All right then.  Let's go.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
So far that's all I seen in this life.
It's one thing to know it...
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
They got a saloon there?
It's not going to be easy.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
The other guy drew first.
We wait.
He'll be here.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Why would they stop you?
Lucky.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Why'd you go into business with him?
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I am telling the truth.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I'm glad we talked.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
The picture's dead.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
I can't wait to meet her.
She'll drive herself.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Yes, call me Simone.
Simone?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
For her?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
How did the wall get there?
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You want me to call Security?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
I was misquoted.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good for you, Hank.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
They are alive, Sayer.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
The background is.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Don't you?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Is that why she left you?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
... digitized.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
He your best buddy?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Who me?
They don't know they're dead?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
No.
Really?
And you know what else?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Don't get mad.
Oh my God.
Dead people.
They talk to you?
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Who!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Two.. maybe three days.
Which street corner?
Sorry.
Not someone -- Mac.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
He's right. Nice guitar break.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Name something.
Look. You want to talk about this?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
What'll we do?
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Whatcha' doin'?
Aspirin.
It's my nature.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Yeah.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Okay.
Having fun.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
You could've asked.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Yeah?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Bandit II?
See ya, Kate.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
I'm cucumber cool.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
He's thirsty.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Now, you just find him, son.
And who has access to that floor?
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Mortal.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
What are you doing here?
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
For real?
A Fed? Like FBI?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Security's locking down the elevators.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
What do you want?
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
All right.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Why did you agree to come here?
You fucking bastard...
Yes.
Oh, that's a relief.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Told you what?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Why?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
No.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Just get him to stop.
Into what?
Yes.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
It's something.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Gibarian.  He was here.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
There's a phone in the car.
I got money.
Yeah.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Oh God, that's great!
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Yeah.
"For"...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
You don't have to, now.
... I don't want to talk about it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Absolutely.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
What's the difference?
I'm all right.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Does it make you... hard?
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I know where everything is.
Lay back, Mack.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's taking singing lessons.
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
That's not even close.
Mr. Jameson--
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
Some things you should say anyway.
Uh is a good start.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
I've gotta study.
I'm sure you kept warm.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Well, no.
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
It'll shut itself off.
I will finish what I've begun…
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Plenty.
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Get going on the trap door.
I don't know anymore.
Yeah. Security.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You stink, Sefton!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Take it.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Sefton!
Not you.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Stop it, Harry!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
What do they always say?
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Anything else?
Yes, sir.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Shoot!
Check.
Give this to Joey, will you?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Give me the radio.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
A chicken?
Where is he?
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I hope so, sir.
All hands, brace for impact!
Why would you want to leave?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Oh, of course.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Better?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
No, I didn't know that.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
How is that possible?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Nothing. As before.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
What is it?
I went wrong.
A photon tube...!
... Or <u>who</u>.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Not exactly.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
The ship... Out of danger...?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Who is this?! How dare you --
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He asked you not to grieve...
... Spock...
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Wait!... Wait...
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
All true.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Is that a poem?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
Who --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
You know what she'll say...
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
A few shots, sir.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
Yes, SIR.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
To be sure, Captain.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
Very well.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I did not think so.
I failed to resolve the situation.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Take the test again.
There is no such regulation.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Aye, sir.
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Try again.
I'll try, Captain.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
We're just -- observing.
I was not informed about observers.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Understood. What is your plan?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Damn!
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Yes.
I see.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Then... Where the hell are we?
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Everyone remember where we parked.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
But not you.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I am better.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Are they in any danger?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Eject the core.
How long 'til they reach us?
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
You've not aged a day since then?
Can you beam him off?
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Not yet.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
More lies.
I'm your creator now.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Contact Starfleet Command.
How serious is the damage?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
What's still there?
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
I'm on it...
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Something wrong with that?
The invasion plans.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
I can try.
What makes you say that?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
We?
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Right.
Understood!
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
No way.  You see this?
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
WHAT HAPPENED?
He just tried to save him!
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Uhura, monitor!
Now we go to Starfleet?
They'll be here...
There's a reward for your death.
It IS possible.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Right -
You have personally -
They're dying.
Why would they give them to us?
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
But I am not human. I am only -
Spock, you want to know something?
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Such things have happened before, sir.
A lie?
An error.
I believe you. Please...
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
What is it?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
I know.
No.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Dying?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
To new worlds...
On my way.
Good work. The download?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Negative.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
And I you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I don't know.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I know how he thinks.
This isn't about me anymore.
No!
This isn't real.

Thank you, Commander.
Sir?
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Still well on our side...
Sir --
Away team. Transporter room four.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
With a full head of hair.
I won't defend my life to you.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
And what of the Enterprise?
Long ago.
Not so long.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
They will obey, Praetor.
But surely...
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Now go. I have some personal business.
I don't think so... 
I understand.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Thank you.
He's got a gun!!
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
Neither did I.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Flashlight.
Pancakes.
X...
Yes.
I know.
I...
Shit!
Three nights... two days.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
When we get here.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
You liked my singing?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
No one's traveling in this weather.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Nothing.
No.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
If you want to keep it, you can.
You could have killed us both!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Slow down, slow down.
What? No, of course not.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
We're ready.
Was there visual contact?
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
Twenty-eight years.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
What're you going to do?
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Least you can do.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
What clip?  What was it?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Your sex life?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
See you downtown.
Just Lenny.
Right.  That explains it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
You're thinking...?
What's the bad news?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
Winona.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
A grill pattern.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Excuse me?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
MyDick.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
Collected shoes too?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
It's a no-no.
I know.
He's called a couple times.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
You mean --
You did.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
What's up?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
What's going on?
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Yeah, of course.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Sit back.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
So you went underground?
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Yeah.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
So you're the new meat?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Speck is dead.
350 miles.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
What do you drive?
You're a comedian?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Tell me about it...
It does.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
I'm a "Dorothy".
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Why not?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Fine... I guess. You?
I miss you, Mike.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Goodbye. I lov... 
So what's the difference?
It sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
It's a gig.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Why?
I didn't mention her once today.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Sounds more like Aids...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
You always know the right thing to say.
So, what? Eleven?
He's trying to be an actor.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
What are they doing here?
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
I don't know...
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
Always, baby.
Always.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
She smiled, baby.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
She likes you.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She was hot.
No, baby. You're money.
I don't think so.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
How?
I just need some time...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
That doesn't matter.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Oh. He's got it under control...
You think?
...double diamond...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
Yeah.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Maybe less...
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
You want him to stay in this country.
Where are you going?
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
They're talking to themselves.
You really want to know?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
My brother, Tom Hagen.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
I'm thinking about it.
Tell me you love me.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Sure.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
I played piano in a few places.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I've got plans!
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
What?
So cool.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Bird. That's jazz.
Dickie?
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I can explain.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Hello Meredith.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
And don't forget. I have the key.
...Tom is a mystery...
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
No.
Of course. What happened to your face?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
That's an expensive gun.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Who mam?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Really?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Huh?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
But... Betsy...
Is he Italian?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
With the other hand, right?
The kind with a brush.
For a fee.
Nah.  I suppose not.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Don't you understand anything?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I can leave anytime I want.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
You don't have to.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes I am.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
So I hear.
No.
Oh?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
Thanks.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's all I could think of.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
It's possible.
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
I do?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yeah...
Oh.
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Nine and-a-half years...
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
... what?
Did you... did you...
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Aren't you coming?
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I taught you that.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Different?
And what had you done?
Then what was it?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
No!
Yes?
Just a little one.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Where?
That's where the Brenners live.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Yes.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
You're doing fine.
We won't be here.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
These birds were...
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
No, of course not.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Yes?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You like me, huh?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Maybe.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
You have a job?
What do you do?
Yes.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
No, thank you.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Almost two a.m.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
What were the crows after at the school?
To...  To kill them.
No one called it a war!
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Then let's go. Now!
I'm only a student.
Yes.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
MacFarlane
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Why, yes.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Don't call me that confounded name.
No.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
The heart pumps it.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I take no gifts from you.
We have never been friends.
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
The strip joint?
Keep that thing away from me.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You killed my daughter.
It still doesn't mean...
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I assure you such power exists.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Just Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
About 250 million of your miles.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I will be in just a minute.
Come on in.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Jittery is the word.
What time is it?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Well, how do I know who you are?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
Yeah.
What's Plan B?
El Vampiro.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
I'll take you there.
Lots more where he came from.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
It was a dream, Star.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Oh, no, you won't.
I'll pass.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
We are...
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Soon.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
In here?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Okay.  Talk.
Me, too.
Why not?
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
The Marines.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Look, I'm just guessing...
That's good enough.
How the fuck do I know?!
Garry's missing!
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
You been made, MacReady.
What for?
Then kill me.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
In this weather?
A serum test possibly.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
You reach anybody yet?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
He's dead.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Calm down and get in your position.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
This is it?
But there's nothing here.
You know of them?
Can you show us where they live?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It frightens you.
What do you mean?
Vox...
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
We make them see what we wish.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
You took her because she helped me.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
What?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
Got here as soon as I could.
You know I can't.
Trust me...
It's only a machine.
Let them.
Do you know you were humming?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
What?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
I'm sorry, David.
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
You're not from beyond the valley.
What makes you say that?
Then you can speak slowly.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
All of you?
I don't understand.
What are you?
Did you have fires at night?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
Orion's belt...
It's undamaged?
No!
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
No, sir --
Sir --
I did...
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
We don't know.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
I am.  Are you a climber?
What about Starks?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
Yes.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
How'd he die?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
What?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I know.
[Beat, lost] No.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
William, you're not making sense.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
So it's helping?
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Why not?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
The Jacket.
Where are you going?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
I'll manage.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
What.
Have a good day at work today.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
Go fuck yourself.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Aw, God.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Yes, sir.  I know.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
You want to come on in?
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Oh, great.
Stop.
I'm spinning.
Shut up.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Peaches.
What?
Maybe.
It's nothin' like that.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Yes.
I'll call you right back.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Get the car!
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Yes.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
I think better when I drive.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Will I be?
Louise.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Taking a shower.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Litterbug.
What for?
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Idaho?
Whaddo we do?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
You mean now or before?
Before.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
You know why.  You already said.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Eeuww.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
How do you stay so positive?
What?!
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Fuck that.
Fuck you.
We're fine!  How are you?
Grrrreat!
You sent that?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Well once. Mary.
I don't know.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Never met him.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
You know, clean the pipes.
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
'That right?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Thanks.
What's that?
I beg your pardon?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
-- Love story of our time.
You want her dead, don't you?
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
How'd you manage that one?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
It means you're too hard on guys.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
What's a mook?
Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Mary, the man's a killer.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Huh?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Who's that?
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Trying to be.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Okay.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
I wish.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
What are you doing?
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
Tomorrow...
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
What's gotten into you?
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Yes it is.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Deal.
This is about Cuba.
Good.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
I know, I know...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Again. Figures, man.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Ray.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
I got one up on ya.
Let's see it.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Yes.
Why?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
Cuz I'm a skin?
What are you talking about?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Who did?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
-- your father was part Sioux.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
That's all!
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Yes, ma'am.
No.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Anything.
Anything.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What truth?
True.
...Something like that.
I hope you find him.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
YEAH, COUGAR?
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Okay, okay.
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
What do you want?
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
So's my Johnson.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Let's go. Eject.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
That's because you don't have any women.
GET LOST!
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
What the hell you doing?
Didn't everybody?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
I lost.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
My wife's house.
I never heard that.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Take me to the hotel.
Get it, please.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
There!  The woman!
C'mon!
Are you saying she liked it?
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
What is it?
Up!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
I'm late.
--I got a trip to Mars.
Oh God, Doug.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I'm honored.
Nice to meet you.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
There's something I have to tell you...
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Inside what?
Like what?
I don't need Kuato for that.
You two-faced-bastard.
Enough for everybody to breathe?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
My cannon.
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
In a minute.
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Why?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
I am not!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Its tires are flat...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Could be.
Let's assume that it is.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
True.
Correct.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
The hell you do. At this hour?
Where's the nearest hospital?
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
What about entrapment?
Can't I take a simple piss without --
Ah.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
You really think that's what happened?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
...Are you sure we want that?
Roger Baron.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
...For ten years, now.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
You do.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Shouldn't one of us...?
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Bobby...
Out back in our morgue.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Yep, it sure is.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's good.
Oh.
It's late, Sam.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
You didn't do your homework?
Noooo...
Thanks.
I don't know what to do.
Oh god, Laura.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Donna, are you my best friend?
If I can smoke it.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Nothing.
No.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You got it.
Bob.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
I'm not.
I am The Muffin.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You mean the ones you pity.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
We're late to get to your mother.
I was down the street.
Look at this finger here.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
You're right. There's no one here.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
I...
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I know of him.
How is that?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
When she...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...I made a reservation at...
The Doctors were not negligent.
Why is that?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
'Code Blue'...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
...and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Who told you that?
One hour.
Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Mr. Concannon...?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I think I will.
Is this a bad time.
Who told you that?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Let me talk to Mickey.
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Who are you protecting, then?
Where is he?
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
That's right.
The Doctors.
What did she do?
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
She told me.
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
He's very excited about it.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
No.
Diabetes?
Absolutely.
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
Bye.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
You didn't jump in.
Seemed, not was.
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Captured?  How?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
That was Nancy, not me!
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
You sound so sure.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Well, that's all part of it.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Yes sir.
No, I can't.
Whatever.
You're not a moron.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
Anonymous.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I gotta go.
Passport?
I can't watch this.
Good.
Forget it.
My dad.
It works?
Who?
Face what?
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Yes.  I do.
What's that?
That's enough.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
... Absolutely not.
No.  I didn't.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
Y'all take American Express?
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What is it?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
No sir...
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
You won't of missed much.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
What's that, peanut?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
I guess.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
You got me, peanut.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I'm goin'.
Yeah.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Told you not to call your mama.
You're scarin' me, baby.
You knew my daddy?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
How'd you know my daddy?
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I'll come along.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
What?
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Like hell.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Santos...
In the head.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
By who?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
He's right, you look horrible.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Because... because...
Yes.
Tripp, where the hell...
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
What's to tell?
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Call it a hunch.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
I put you on the floor.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Washed up?
Hm.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Your aunt?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Outside Scranton.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Jealous? Of me?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Yes, James.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
That strikes me as odd.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Grady!
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
That good, huh?
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
All right. This morning --
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
I think I might have.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
James is... I don't know...
What's that?
Grady?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I'm in love with your wife.
Only when I'm working.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Just a few then. The big ones.
Beautiful. How's business?
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
Something wrong with that?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
I bet you can.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
The one with the ax?
The girl.
No.
I could take you downtown.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Apartment's okay.
Why's that?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
It sounds like you were banished.
Banished... yeah.
Robin?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Yes.
How do you know?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
I wish you'd give it a try.
It's okay.
Honest? No.
You have no feelings for your niece?
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
We have a lot of work to do.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
I don't know!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
All right.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Are you okay?
I thought you were a dyke.
K through sixth.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Sounds like a special guy.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Just think about it.
Not when they fly.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Your rig?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
It's trying to communicate.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Hi, lady.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
All right.  Do it!
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Missed what?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Wilhite, anything?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
How deep?
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
She'll wait.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
What! After giving us such a run around...
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Are you joking?
What! Get married?
I deserve it.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
It couldn't be any clearer.
Who's moving?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
I think it's possible.
Yes, yes, of course.
You men are all so dreadful!
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
No, not like this one.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
No. The owners are in Australia.
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
They didn't seem too good.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Yes.
Who?
One of the other Sisters?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's not what he meant.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Oh my dear child.
Yes, of God.
I don't know.
Yes, Mother.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Are you married?
Not at the moment, no.
One.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
What else did she tell you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
I could never be a mother.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
You can tell me.
Oh, yes.
Are you intelligent?
As much as God loves you.
Of what?
Of telling you.
Because I was afraid.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Him.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
It was alive wasn't it?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
How do you survive?
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
Who was the father?
None as far as I know.
Why do you think that?
That's ridiculous...
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
And what happened?
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I haven't decided yet.
You just said...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
The father!
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Hasn't she had enough?
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Are you now?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah.
What they like?
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
He comes from a large family.
Follow your impulse.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Are you pulling my leg?
Thank you.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
What are you?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is she?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are they saying?
Eh?
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Shall I?
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Don't start. Look.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Paul's grandfather.
That's too easy for Lennon.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
A proper Aborigine.
Kill drive engines.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.  Two hours.
But functioning.
Play it for us, please.
Hard to say.
Yeah!
How's it coming on the engines?
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Dead!
Right.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
He's running a fever.
How do we locate the creature?
What do you mean, no?
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
We can use the flamethrower.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Thanks for the thought. 
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
You lead.
How far?
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Yes, thank heaven.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
About four hours.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
With great pleasure.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
What's that supposed to mean?
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Kablooey.
What did it do to you?
Kill me...
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Better tell the boss.
We're what!?
Get her on-line.  Now!
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
What's our weapons situation?
Not yet.
But...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Where does that lead to?
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
And before that?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Yes. I do.
Eddie what?
I believe I will.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
Why'd call me a killer?
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
And too many of them are produced.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Of course I knew.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Where?
Huh?
I'll try.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
That I am...
I get a party, don't I?
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
It won't play.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Who?
Don't mix your metaphors.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Here we go...
Paranoiac!
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
You know what I'm going to be?
Just wondered what?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
Is that what you want me to be?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
You're quite a girl.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Oh-oh.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
You were just looking around...
You probably won't believe me.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
How long does it take?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Well...
Hollywood.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
'Remembrance'.
Not at all...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
I wouldn't like.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
She's just outside the door.
Harrington.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
About what?
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Where'd you get all that information?
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
With gestures, of course.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I'm a human being, I've got some!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
I have no intention of having an accident!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
I mean really, deeply angry...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
--it was fine the way it was--
--no way--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You voted for him.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--I know, I know--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Mind if I try?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Sure--off the record.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
We've just been talking to Young--
--what about you?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Hey, easy...
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Something maybe big.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
I don't know titles.
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
So?
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
No.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Nobody ever had too much.
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
--well, Sloan--
Anyone but Bernstein.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
He just did.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
The what to what?
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
You need some work, buddy!
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Yep.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn't --
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
You can't sing at the competition.
Please.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Yeah, enormous.
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Yes.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
No -- Kevin, you?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Nadia, I can't --
Just a second!
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Uh huh.
Doing what?
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
What...?
Where?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like he lied to you too.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
When you're older . . .
Yes, your highness.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Trying... to... breathe...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Run, Anya -  go...
You gave the orders!
Perhaps you could convince her?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
This is Alvy Singer!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
What do you mean, next?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, why not?
Tsch.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Well, stop listening to him.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
You-you play... very well.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Okay.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, right.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Okay.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Why not?
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah.
Oh.
big subject with me, yeah.
Those are the two categories...
No, I'm not.
You- Do you love me?
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
It relaxes me.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
Are yuh?
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
M'hm.
Sinatra?
David! David! I can't believe this!
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Oooh.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
What?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
That's sick!
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I did.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Dammit! I was so close.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
Hey.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
M'hm.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
There are no twos, Max.
How do you like this couple, Max?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Oh yes.
Was it a contractor?
One guess.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The movie.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
He's allergic.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
It's not going to come up.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
You should have brought him.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
And?
She left a note.
Monica.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
A perfect night.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Yeah, thanks pal.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
They're paying him scale.
Scout's honor.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
It's taken care of.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Okay, knock it off.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
He'll find his way back.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't do this.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Me too.
Oh, you know, I am.
Not long.
And I you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Lemon.
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Sorry?
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Are you working on a new book?
How long ago was it?
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Not enough.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I wasn't finished.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Yes.  Fine.
Why not?
Well, something's wrong.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
And here they are!
Like Joe.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Hm.
I trust you.
And the food sucks, I know.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
You weren't exactly horrified.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Really?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You're right!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Want a list?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Superior numbers, kid!
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
ARREST HIM!
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Alright, let's move out!
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
I'll be back.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Really?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Three.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Let me help you.
You don't want me here --
I'll fix you some coffee.
His apartment?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Do I have to?
I just want some fresh air.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Oh.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
You usually eat alone?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
Fine. How's your eye?
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Sir?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
How do you work it with the key?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
You know how people talk.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Sir?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Sir?
You left your wife?
Yeah --
Yes, sir.
Very clever.
How's that again?
So what's it going to be?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Well, I have things to do --
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
That so.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
My shoes.
Kubelik.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Doctor.
And what happened to you?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Will you excuse me?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I want you back, Fran.
Handle what?
What do you think?
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What are you talking about?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby what?
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
No.
None.
Rangers, eh?
Fat. That's real fat.
Who are you ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Call me what, sir?
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
Maybe.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Captain?
Thank you, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
You want'a surf, soldier?
I met him.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Music?
You know you're right.
You can't have water after morphine.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
What are you doing?
You knew him best.
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Nah.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
You're Australian?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Why?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
You know Meyerling?
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Just passing through.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Yes.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I see the help -- judgement call.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
How ya doing?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
And?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
Go ahead.
Were you asleep?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
How to die, mostly.
I'll take care of myself --
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Think white and get serious.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Well, that's a load off.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Come on, sweetheart...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
How long have you been freelance?
Bullshit.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
What does that fucking mean?
Sick.  The flu.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
Where are we going?
Yeah.
We don't have a choice.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Because I'm done.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
I told you, he will.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Yes.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Is this becoming complicated?
Shit.
Okay.
Electra --
Last night --
A pleasure doing business with you.
Sometimes.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
What are you thinking about?
What do other guys do?
Some.
This will take some time.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
I've been saying that since we met.
Can you do the lock on it?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Nope.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
It just happened.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Lucky break!
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I'm not hungry, really.
You're sure?
No, by road?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Ooh, well excuse me.
How about you Brutus?
What?
What? You are crazy!
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Fernet and tonic.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I hope so!
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
Don't worry. Thanks.
How?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Cool!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
No problem, is it at your place?
What for?
Why?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
I do.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
'Bout what?
No. I won't be long.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I'm just wondering --
Me.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
That is my telescope.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for something -- someone.
My relationship with God is my own.
You don't believe in anything?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
You don't miss a thing.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
It means you can do anything.
Where?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
I don't care.
I'm sick.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
So talk to us about something.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Yes.
I'd do that --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Thank you.
I beg your pardon?
No....
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Learn anything?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Okay, then!
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Home, school, here... 
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Why?
You know me?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
What if you lost your keys?
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
That's just what I needed to hear.
Perfect...
What theater was I at?
Sure,.
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
What do you mean?
He never bit me.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Yeah.
What's your friend's name?
Nothing.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Okay.
I don't care.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Yes.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
No.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Maybe.
It's mine all right.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Who?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Any time.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Pictures don't lie.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
...Who is this?
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Then who should I talk to?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Yeah...
Hi, Charlie.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
Yeah, but –
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Hold on –
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
Yeah.
Nine days – Tuesday –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
He's a little funny in the head.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Home. Watching TV.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
No?
No, Nick, please --
Was there anyone with you last night?
I have nothing to hide.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
That's right.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Please.
What if I call you Nicky?
It's not the same thing, is it?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
I'll risk it.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Of course I knew.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Come over here and tell me no.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Yes I am.
What was the weapon?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I never heard of him.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
What is it you got between you?
I know what that's like.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Are you vice?
Can there be some mistake?
I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
The whole thing – painting.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
No.
Aren't they?
How do you know?
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Yup.
Should there be?
Out?
– In this corner?
Oh yeah..
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Your people.
Good.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Drugs??!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
You don't have any fucking money..
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
What's wrong with me?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
What's his name?
Me? Why?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Some of them.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
What time is it?
Forget it.
I need this?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
What're you really after?
I'm listed.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Dad!  Save yourself!
All is shrill, all is blight...
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
And a very, very good one.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
You'd be surprised.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
What exactly are you doing?
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I can make it.
Umm-hmmmm.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
You lie!
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
I find that unlikely.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Actually, he took the car.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...Afraid.
What?
Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
My life's an open book. You read?
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Just ones this beautiful.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
Not much.
And into a black dress.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
And now....
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
...Not the bat?
What?
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
The small one.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
That's it?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
He's not crazy.
It's gone.
And what did you say?
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Did you really ask?
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Sort of half.....
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
No, I'm fine.
What happened?!!!
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Certainly is.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Sure.  You're right.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Great, good.
Well, there is that ...
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
I am sorry you feel that way.
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
You.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. Yeah.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Thrr...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Deep and hard.
Not now Bork.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, ten uh...
I am sitting.
... Hmmm?
What's she doing here?
That's my girl!
They make gypsies look good.
That's all we need.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Let's see if she can get my model back.
We were trying to scare your mother.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No.  You don't want his help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Our cemetery?
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
We're practicing.
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
I want to get in.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Delia hates it.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.
... sheets.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Maybe Charles does.
Look at the tiny figures.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Hardly any, Robert.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... But he's...?
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
No. I like this attic very much.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
That's good.
Your leg must be getting better.
So am I, Eve.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
That's very interesting, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Yes. I would like to do that.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Oh.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
I was given meals, and a home...
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
No headaches?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
It's not that, I just...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
So...? Where the hell is it?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
It's that serious, huh?
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Malkovich!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Hi.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back now.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Yes.
I love you so much.
The iguana?
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No. I understand perfectly.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'm right?
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Please, let me explain.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
What kind of circumstances?
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Thank you, Floris.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Is there dancing?
How'd you get this number?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
You mean with Malkovich?
It's okay, my sweet.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying nothing counts?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
Baby, don't be like that.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
What you want?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Well, what can you do?
Extra?
Go upstairs I said!!
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
True.
He's sleeping in the church.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Aw, no, Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
She was only-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Why me, man?
Uh-huh.
Shit.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Nothing.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Yeah, but we're--
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
They were Nazis, Dude?
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Which one was Logjammin'?
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
He fixes the cable?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
What do you do for fun?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
What?
This was a valued, uh.
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
No, but--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Thanks Walter.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Huh?
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Huh?
And the fucking money!
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
You know this!
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
You're a fuck, Walter!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
...Us? DUDE
Yeah.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Any casualties?
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
You should've killed her, then.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're wrong.
Pass.
Who is LaMagra?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
You get used to the darkness.
For your miracle cure?
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
What are you talking about?
I was afraid that might happen.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
But you use blood banks --
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
What is <u>this</u>?
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
I don't know.
I want to see the tapes.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
Looks like a rope.
--no, I think they're all in there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Too busy eating us?
Down there in the Park.
Next time try putting on shoes--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--now there.
By day? No sweat.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Why?
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
At least you still have the tapes.
....I don't know.
--I know!
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
I just gotta see a guy.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Abby... you all right?
You're bad.
...What do you mean?
...What was that?
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Nah, I trust ya.
Right.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
You did? A human ear?
The criminals are winning.
Yeah.
Baby wants to fuck.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
O.K.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Please. please stay.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Frank would open you.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay. okay.
Oh yeah?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Be right down.
Yeah?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Well.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Um-hmm.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Get me a six pack.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Now do you see what I am saying?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Try the back bedroom.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Cocaine?  How much?
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Actually, it was three.
Freedom.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
I know.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
That's where you belong...
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
What?
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Better than you.
Well, here I am.  See?
You can call me Dad if you want.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
But I've got school.
I don't believe you.
I didn't mean to...
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
That's right.
And you believe the NLF?
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Third group. What's your assignment?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What ... What must I decide?
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Not enough.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Sure ...
I think it'll be a success ...
No, and neither were my men.
But it's not even midnight yet!
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Why?
You got something on the Coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
The official cause?
Then how did it get into his body?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What was the nature of the argument?
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Counsel approach the bench.
Sit down, Frank.
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
You've been following me?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Six years.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Yes.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Why not?
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
Can you give the court an example?
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
How?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
Yes.
Yes.
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
It won't be that hard.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I am relaxing.
Yes.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
I'm not.
Sorry.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
I know. I don't understand it either.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
That's it!
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I bet mom could've helped her.
She changed.
Heat is heat.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Maybe it's because I live here.
No, really?
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Sure.
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Then what happened?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
You must get lonely at times.
What made you ask such a question?
Wonderful. Uh...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Sure.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Nobody's asking you to.
Near the church.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Because I already tried once.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
Yeah. It could get better.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Okay.
Apparently just before her death.
WHAT!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Wh-wh-whooo?
What it will be.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Let me see your hand.
Hush, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
We met.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
And the hell everybody else, right?
Have you ever been inside?
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Why?
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Patrick, he's...
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
You were just a kid.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
What building?
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Shit, that was fast.
Potential toxic dump site.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Stay away!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
It couldn't have been.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
All right, Caesar.
This is insane!
I need you ...
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
You murdered Gino!
Good idea.
Okay, sure, Mick.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Me?  Why?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm already in your bed.
I guess I wanted to.
Shit, here we go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
For what?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
Then what?  Exactly.
Good.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
What did Gino drink?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I'm here, aren't I?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
I think everything is okay.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
You're asking me a direct question?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
What do you want to do?
Yes.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
I think so.
Why?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Look, maybe I should just...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
For twenty thousand dollars.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
I trusted you.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
What?
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
Not really.
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
Get everyone down in the basement.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>Where am I</u>?
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
You must save the day.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Beginner's luck.
You sound worried.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
You remember Alison?
Er, I knew you looked different.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
So how ...?
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
And you're mine.
Take her off the list.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
What?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
Information Adjustments.
If you say so.
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
No.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Looking for you.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
We've got both.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Let go! We've got to stop!
Are you still following me?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Oh, good!
Really.
Tuttle?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
What?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I never signed the form.
You want to take my console into your office?
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Thank you for calling Cen -
Thank you, Dawson.
We'll be back.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
What?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
No ...
It's a miracle.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
His heart's beating.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I think this place stinks.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He's better, though, right?
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
Fifteen minutes.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
God help us, he's hungry too.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I need a drink, that's all.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Okay, whatta I do?
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Yeah, you're right.
You really think so?
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
And the rule was...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
No.  Don't worry about it.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Did you shoot their boots?
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
No.
Then it went well.
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Sit down, stop.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'm going to take it.
Your hair's a little funny.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
We could...
Should I...
Bobbie, please.
Bad manners.
One's enough.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
...good-bye then.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Honey?...
Go ahead.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
It's not opinion.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Yes, sure.
Hey?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Billion.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Who?
Me!
Good.  That's it...See you.
Where are you?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
You're saying stay away from him.
Not anymore!
Oh yeah?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Are you nervous, Walter?
Let's see it.
Better!
There there...
Sorry...
Thank you.
Bye!
You think I'm creative?
There's...a body inside that statue!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
When did you make this, Walter?
Leonard, what are you doing?
Why not?
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
They are?
I-I already got a new one!
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Good morning Walter!
Your work, the layers of irony.
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
Coach knows what abs are?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Bummer metaphor.
You didn't like them.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Yeah, I guess.
Eeyuu.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Water.  Okay.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Like what?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Lothos.
Why do you keep saying that?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
They were vampires?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Don't start with me again.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
As for example, what?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
They don't even have Dolby.
That's the plan.
I guess.
Thanks.
Nicole...
Really?
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Okay, what else?
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Catch?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Oh my...  Don't leave...
You're pulling your hips out.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
It's possible.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
I can do that, too.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
You got a live arm there.
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Which one of us?
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
You missed him!
Well, I held it like an egg.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You been in the Majors?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
You're the boss.
Let go of me!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Can I give you my testimony?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
It's a miracle.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Okay...
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
What?
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
The worst was Blue.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
She's not here, Sam.
Right away.
I'll call you right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Help, Daddy!
I don't know.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
My wife?
Listen, I would -
...to me.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
What - what, Caesar's?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
I just told you. She called me.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Well...
I'll be right there.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Good to meet you.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
What is it?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I - I - I...
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
No.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
What?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Get - get up!
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
They had all the pieces they needed.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah.
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Hi. Good.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Please.
And here. Here.
Pitch-black?! It -
Here we go!
Nicky, I'm sorry.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
It's instinctive, you know.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Hm.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Sure.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I know what you mean.
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Yeah.
Bye.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Is that what you want?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
What about my money?
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
I told you I was hot tonight.
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
That's right.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
It means I got the money.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
You know why, right?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What's takin' so long over there?
Remo.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Get out. Get out! Get out!
No, no, no, no!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Hey.
How you doin'?
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
I'm sure.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Wha-at?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Absolutely.
Now he'll be up all night...
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
Oh now this one is mine...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
But I'm blind.
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
How much time do you have left on it?
Our house always needs touching up.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
That makes two of us.
She's gone --
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
It won't be him.
Lucky for them they didn't.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Put the man back on.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Damned if I know.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Did you hear that?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
That's not good enough.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Some loyalty.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Better reassure him.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Five minutes.
How do you know?
Doesn't everybody?
He gave me a look.
Fuck it, is what I say.
You fucking did.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
She's not a tart.
What?
Whatever it is she does for you.
Who?
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
What look?
Jesus.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Didn't think I could.
A real gentleman...
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Depends what it is.
Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Made me feel all funny inside.
So I'm sorry.
Will you meet me again?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
A little.
Sorry.
Only if you kiss me.
He'd bring me carnations.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
More than that.
Sorry. What you doing?
My pills...
Don't go like that.
Don't you want to kill me?
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
What's that supposed to mean?
Need to go across the water.
Aha.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Leave me alone, Jude.
I know.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
What do you mean?
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
You sure?
Peter.
I know that.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
No?
Suppose you could say that.
Shut up, would you?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
You're crazy --
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
No -- I guess not.
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Open up.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
With whom? Where?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Of course there is!
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
Agent.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Ours.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
But --
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Steal it how?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Agents.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Bartholomew?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
You'd lie about anything.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Then who does?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Whitefoot, of course.
I think I love you, Alex --
Tuesday.
No.
Who?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
What do you mean?
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Yes.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In money.
Why bother him?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
I don't know anything.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
How's that?
Peter Joshua.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
I'm not sure I --
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Lay on, MacDuff.
I don't think I follow you.
I wasn't --
What your husband was mixed up in.
On the street where you live.
What?
Good night.
So they think he left it with you.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
The American Embassy.
Yeah? What's that?
Why?
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
Calm down Brent.
I will. Is that all?
I thought you'd be pleased.
Run!
St. Michael's.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Why?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Of course I'm scared.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
NO?!
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Follow me.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I don't know. I kind of am.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
You're not telling me something.
Kenny's aunt?
Maybe you better just drive me home.
If sheep don't count.
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
...shit.

Would you hurry up, please?

No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
I did not steal this truck!
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Take your gun!
 Nice job back there.
...-cho and a hijack-...
You wanna hit me?
I did not steal the truck.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.

Okay.  Okay.

Oh, no!


What?
Worth a try.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...

I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
We got two paddles.

Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Are you all right?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Reach into my pocket.
Oh.

Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Honest?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Just find the girl.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
What are you talking about?
Ain't worth thinking about.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
I think I'll kill her.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
But what?
I get by.
Since I made Lieutenant.
How do you happen to know her?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
What?
What do you mean?
...Just a minute...
A check?
How did you find out?
She's cheating on him.
Mr. Gittes.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
That your maiden name?
No. I'm just a snoop.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
So you married your father's business partner?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
No.
What? What is it?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
When was the last time?
What were you doing there?
Working for the District Attorney.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
This morning.
Give me an example.
Including the death of your husband?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
...That's not what I meant.
What did you do that for?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my daughter.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
When did you come in?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Help yourself.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Well, no.
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
They were partners.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Somebody stole it.
Where is he?
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You don't really think so?
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
You know why?  She was so -
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Emily -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Toothache.
Hmm!
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Would you sing for me?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
All right.
Do you know what that is?
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
I mean I've got a job for you.
I'd like that.
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
That's the train with all the lights.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Hey, Nurse!
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
I had a toothache.
Rosebud?
Am I sure?
How long have you been smoking?
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
He went home to change for the big date.
Why aren't there any lights?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Like what?
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Then who operated the store?
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
Peptic ulcer.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
She called you Brad?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Allan Harris.
I'm talking to myself here.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
The quest isn't going well?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
FUCK!
What?
Don't yell at me, pal.
You've got a customer.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Julie Dwyer died.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
I never tried it.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Jesus!
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy to get a fine?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
I was born.
As if it's that easy.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Lovely story.
Why do you say that?
Same time. What about you?
Helluva day.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm her sister.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yeah.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
I'm not dealing.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
I should start.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
At least they weren't lit.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
What were you doing?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Three?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
A couple...?
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
What?
I didn't do that!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Because he's out of shape.
Yeah!
I hope it feels good.
Screw you!
I have first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Hal will have my head for this.
I admit, I can be bought.
You're getting warmer!
The clip's not gonna hold!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
My pleasure.
Not on that leg.
Patience my love, patience.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Never
Do it, goddammit!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
What about you?
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
My wife... Alex freezes.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Fine, sir, fine.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
I beg your pardon?
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Good.
Where is he now, sir?
Keeping fit then?
Oh, aye, aye.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
No, brother. What d'you want?
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Yes!!!
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Indeed.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Big, big money.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Thank you.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Bottega.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Dozen times a day.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
You still carrying passengers?
Jesus...
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
The crowd had to dig it.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
No harm done, ma'am.
I brought you flowers.
I'm standing right here.
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
I was just tryin' to...to...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I'm cool.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
What'd he do to you?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
What you mean, no?
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Jazz.
Don't start.
Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
One more.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Answer the question.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
I think you're different.
No.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Never heard of him.
How is it possible?
Realized what?
A water main broke.
You will?
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Where are you?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Terminal?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Anything happening in there, El?
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
Good luck, David.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
It's a civilian facility.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
Is that your official response?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No.  Please.
I didn't realize I was out.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Any luck on the grant money?
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
But what about your research -- ?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Make that two.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Something like that.
You're willing to die for this.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
What is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
Have your department make a full report.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Borrowin'.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
What happened? How far did you get?
Get away!
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
He's gonna be awright.
Well, whatta we got here?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Innocent?
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
What you mean, Luke?
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
I never hurt nobody...
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I don't have it...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Who?
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
But it's a different m.o.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
Oh, I know.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You came in there with this attitude...
I like women like that!
Talk to Nikko...!
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Because I think I'm wrong.
Or the F.B.I.?
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
It's about time.
It is?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I don't want to hear anymore.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
I'd have to see it on.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I didn't say...
You too, Mom.
By color.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
That must be really difficult.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Anything interesting.
Really?    Me too.
What are the delusions like?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
But I do.     I love you, too.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
You like it?
Yeah.    How was the job search?
It's hard to know where to start.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
No, it's not like that.
I think you're overreacting.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
That's a big question.
Especially this last year.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Here's the ring.
I start on Monday.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
And?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Where are you staying?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
Because you're the closest.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Where are you from?
Cops?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
No.
I'll be Elvis and you--
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
What'd you get?
What do you want now?
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
What?
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Go look.
What is it you do, Sami?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
You see that car?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
No thank you.
Watch this.
Where is it, Sophie?
What does arresting us get them?
We don't know that for sure.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
You ask a lot of questions.
It's not your fault.
Sounds boring.
A little?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Okay.    Okay.
Then leave her to me.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
So what if I don't?
I have a guest.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
They forced me to marry!
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Give it back!
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Make a wish, Lo.
You were enlightened?
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
Well, we had talked...
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Save your strength.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
I don't know...
Don't thank me.
No further.  I'm serious.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
I lost my key.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
It's just the dope, don't worry
No.
I think he's yours, now.
I went to see a friend of mine.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I can see her.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Fine with me.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Move in, guys.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Annette Harrison.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Who?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm in love with you.
Where are you going?
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Those are my letters!
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I don't know.
Okay.
I don't know.
Well what then?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
But I thought high school is only four years.
I look terrible.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
No.
Prude.
I know.
You do?
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Who told you?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
One.
Ronald?
No.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Shut up and turn to page 64.
I'll think about it...
I'm working on it.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
So? How'd it go last night?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
And if I don't?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I need to talk to Annette.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
We played backgammon?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
I got my wish anyway.
Irena.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Well, it seemed to me --
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Yes, daddy.
Can't you tell me later?
Daddy, it's true.
Let me be the judge of that.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
My dolls. We can pretend.
Oh, thank you, Amy.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
Yes, Amy.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
No, thank you.
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Anybody could know that song.

I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
No.
Your lips look delicious.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Can't you get contacts?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
No. I don't think so.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Your desk.
A little.
No.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
Very well then. Is that all?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Are you following me?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
No, she died when I was twelve.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
What happened?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
You didn't say it.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Thanks.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
And he was missing an arm.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Not really...
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Sorry, sir.
Iím sorry...
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Who?
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
Shut up!
You know something about me?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
How do you know I'm innocent?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Right and don't embellish.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
I'm... not... nobody...
Yeah.
Fine...
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
I can't believe he'd do this.
What about containment, Alan?
Nobody's got clean kids.
Are you out of your mind?
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Oh.  Fine.
What I told him to?
Don't do this.
Dave -- I'm working.
That'd be great.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
Oh my gosh...
Oh, yeah... probably...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
At a press conference.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Does it make the cars any better?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
They re not my attack dogs.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
I can't say.
No.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You made their funding disappear!
You have a lot of secrets.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
That's okay.
What?
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Then why did you come here?
Leave him.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
We got a boat.
Come on. Let's go.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
No wonder they're so....hungry.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I don't think they're in school.
Well?
So much the better.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
You can't be in here.
Then come with me.
I didn't know you taught.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Courtyard?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Yawp!
YAWP!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
Then you can help him.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
What?
But if he said no before then...
From you?
Oh..
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
What the hell are you talking about?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Did you clear this?
Just trying to get to my boat...
Who asked you to!
Jesus Christ lady...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
On the side!!
You're saying they can think?
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
So?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Me??
Joey...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
I have been.
A passenger...
I know...
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Get the boots.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Who's going?
It's gotta!
Who? Who is?
It won't open.
Married?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
No.
But I insist.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Too bad.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
What?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
You're going hunting?
What?
Hey. Look. There must be something.
C'mon. I've got the car.
I want to go home, Merle.
Merle, I wanna go home!
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
Hell no!
Promise! You gotta promise!
I'm doing that too.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Forget Sal.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
No. No way!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
That's my plan.
What's that noise?
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
You didn't get a deer?
What's it for??
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
The fuck I did!!!
Kimberly!
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Fine.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
How do you know?
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Drop it.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Not too good.
Not yet.
Of course I will.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I didn't.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
But I like the new one better.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Black Dan'l?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Belle --
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Some other time, Stevens.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't care.
I'm through with you.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Never!
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
Ten throws it is.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez!
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Mary!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Married.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
So I've heard.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Bullshit.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Yes, I would.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
You're really crazy.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Well, then...
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
I got Sal.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
They were ...
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Give me the keys...
If you take anybody, please take me.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
No you don't.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Okay.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Yes...
What kind of a deal?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
Okay, when do I get them?
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I have to see.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Sonny - Here's your document.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Doing what?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>

My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.

<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
Nobody.
Is that the only tape you got?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
No, you the man.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
No!
It's gonna be hot today.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Sorry, comb got caught.
I'll do.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
We both do.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Why you gotta curse?
Lie down, please.
To get my money.
Be a man.
You're still late.
Remember what I said.
I didn't know you could read.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Yeah.
I was going to buy a slice.
On the rebound.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
I like Mookie a lot.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Heddo Jeth-ica.
I'm fine.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
So boys, how was your first day?
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
I go to school where I live.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Shut up!
You take that back!
No.
I didn't know that.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
I bet you want your head scratched.
The answer is George Jefferson.
A turd.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Am not.
I don't know who we are anymore.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
I know.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
I'll talk to you later.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
No.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
You got the Extender?
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
Sire!
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
As the legend says.
Yes...
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Long live the fighters!
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Huh?
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Of course!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
I didn't feel well...
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
I never said I could ad-lib...
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Huh?
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Eddie, how was I?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
Sound!
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Boris Karloff!?
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Does she have room for me?
But you used to say --
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Would that work?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
But Greta say --
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
So you're not a fruit?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
The marriage already ended.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
My chiropractor!
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Yes!
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
Mr. Wood!
No! Do they show you having sex?
Who?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Went --
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
What?
Cool.
What if Shari's the dream?
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Good luck.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!!
She could've been a nurse.
And what did he come back now for?
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No.
She left.
Who's in it?
Oh... how come?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Twenty-nine.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Okay.
What?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What are you drunk?
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
We'd better go...
Me?! That's you!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
What...
Do you still have it?
Hm?
No.
What is? Oh, dinner!
Ed?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Anything wrong?
Do it!
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
So nice
You're kidding, right?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Hello, Tracy.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
People can see this.
So?
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
We talked.
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Dudley, what do you want?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
No!  Please leave!
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
What?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
I don't know.  I swear it!
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Just show me where they are!
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
His blood's always up.
And now you'll provide them.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
That's right.
Just don't shoot me.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Yeah.  My whole life.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Why not?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Under the house.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Sid, it's Vincennes.
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What happened with the kid and Loew?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
I called my wife!
You told me no calls.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Here?
Fuckin-A.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
We're not gonna hurt you.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Reynolds.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
Who's calling?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Law enforcement?
Are you sure about this?
Oh my God.
Because my life is being ruined.
Thanks.  Who are you?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
What kind of trouble.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Have you been working with Rachel?
I've seen it.
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
It wasn't me.
Stacy--
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Don't count on it.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
Oh.
What answer were you--
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
Thank you.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I'm sorry about that.
It's not me?
He didn't.
Fuck off.
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
She can't talk to you right now.
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Hi, dad.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Yeah.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Why would the NSA--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Jerry?
It's been a few years.
Tell me about it.
The police?
Sir--
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Federal Express?
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Puffed cheese?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
Her or me?
I'd like you to have them.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Don't.
Good.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Now.
What do you hate most?
No.
You will.  You will.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
What's the matter with you?
When's Clifton picking you up?
Okay.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Or was it Toronto?
So was my Patient.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
What if I told you he did this to me?
I liberated it.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
What did you say?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
K is for Katharine.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
Would you like me to?
You get Hardy.
I follow the wires.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
It's what I've learned.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Then come with me.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
No you can't.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Uh, yes.
No. Why would I be?
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Well, no...but...
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Possibly.
Not a word.
But--
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Not funny.
I'm not the one to ask...
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
In a week.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
A billion dollars.
You don't know the half of it.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
The what?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
So you think we got 'em scared?
What, you think I'm made of money?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
When?  Where?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Have you been to the water board?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
It happens all the time.
I don't know.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
In the conference --
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
How?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm gonna clean it up.
What?  But you been working so hard --
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Keep your voice down.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
What?
The Emperor?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
You won't.
Howls.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
I have felt it.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Or you ran into something ....
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
You look silly.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Repairs ...
What have you done to my ship?
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
We have no use for your kind.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
That they are.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
It is the future you see.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
What?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Locked.
Right over there.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
If he lets you get close enough.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Give me the prototype.
Who ain't?
...I saw nothing.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
So be it.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
And you cannot love me...
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
People make you laugh?
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Hiding?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Just five or six people.
Me too.
May I ask...?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Why the math?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Please go away.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Pretty close?
You wouldn't.
I beg your pardon?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No
Father?
Um........Stuff.
You like it?
The closet
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain who?
You like him.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Who are you?
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Why?
In the face of the enemy.
Defender of the human race...
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
Who's in it?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
I could have you deported, you know that?
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
No.
Yeah, come on in.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Honey ...
They're falling out.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Recognize these two characters?
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Says who?
Her hands.  Like that.
We don't get a gig.
Terrific.
I don't know what you mean.
No?
No.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
I'm not unhappy.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I didn't get her number.
Okay?
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
So what do you think?
Sunday.
Right.
Unless you want the right.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
No. Why?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Huh?
The tenth's out.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Twenty-eight years.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Shut up, Frank.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
No.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Spur of the moment.
The audience was a little off tonight.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
The flu.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Where's my name?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Changed?
What's he talking about?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Hey!
Nine.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Oh, thanks.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Peggy Lee?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Uh ...
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Is that important?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Black.  Labrador.
Not for money. With my mother.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Huh?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
So why's he do it?
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Better than that.
You were good.
How do you know?
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Yeah... No.
Vegetables.
I've given it up.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Wow.
Merry Christmas.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
You mean if I get sick?
Drive.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
Like ...
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
I'm late for surgery.
Must've been after we got engaged.
No.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Shoot him!
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
I won't tell mom if you don't.
I'm just having some fun.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Just following your example.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
What do you know about it?
The hospital.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Why Jack?
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
What about me?
Seven.  Really.
What’s going on here?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Bye...
Big Ed’s.
Mom liked it.
Trouble at work?
I don’t think so.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Yes you do...
Damn, you are the real thing...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You just said everyone needs something.
What?!
It’s lovely...
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
Okay, chief.
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
HEY!
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
How do you even know about this place?
And now...?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
I need you, tiger..
Not exactly. I’ve seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Hey, are you okay?
Last night was great...
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
<u>Should</u>?
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Ben, are you there?
I can go hotter!
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
And if he's not...?
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Not at all.
What?  What do you mean you --
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
And reverse the mutations --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
I gave him twenty.
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
Why didn't you say something?
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Oh, I think you already have.
Here's the overall Target Area...
The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Message to Proteus.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Trip? Where to?
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
With no laser --
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
We're pushing oxygen today.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
You may learn to like it.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
Go ahead.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
I'll do what I can.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Yeah.
We split that.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Yah.
We need more -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, don't be silly.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Yah.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
And what about the other fella?
Oh, yah?
A subconscious-type thing.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Hold on.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
Yah, I see.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Well, what do ya mean?
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Yah.
Okay.
...Is everything okay?
Yah.
I know it's a lot.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
...There's a million dollars here!
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
No, no, that's fine.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Nope.
So?
Uh-huh.
...Mike Yanagita!
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
So... they didn't...
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Copy.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Not on your feet too much?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
He's at Norstar.
He's at -
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Some of it, yes.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Practicing what?
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I don't know -- am I?
The girl had done her homework.
Deal.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
It's for men.
I'm just on my way out...
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I could check your prostate.
Well... thanks, anyway.
What do you get out of it?
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Is this a trick?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I've done you enough favors.
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Okay, everyone.
Pardon me?
What do you want me to do?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Thank you.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
All gone.
What list?
I don't... think so.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Strange.
Anyone?
My dad.  No question.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.
Hum.
What?
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Promise you won't.
What is it?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
No.
I don't think that's true.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Wait a minute...
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
This is not about martyrdom.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Not exactly according to plan.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
What have you left for me?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Appreciate something.
Well, sir, you said you might.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Really?
Yes, it is.
No, please, no, God, no!
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Signs?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
What?
No.  What's this about?
Take a guess.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
That it's not over yet.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Let us out!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
That's what I'm doin'!
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Star Wars?
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Exactly.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Crazy motherfucker.
Intelligence work.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
I couldn't get you in.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
What's the plan?
What?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Nice work.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
That's it.  My life.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
You still believe in God?
The moron?
I... You're not going to understand this.
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
He's not here.
It was a crime.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Bingo!
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
I don't like horror movies!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
I never say anything I have to.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
No.
Out where?
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Is what you?
Who said I was depressed?
No.
Washington.
Alaska.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Now don't...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Sometimes.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
But what about me?
And you no longer play at all?
Swimming?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
What?
What?! I can't hear you!
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It's a Borzoi.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Well, I should hope not...
That's an old maid's tale.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Well, she was.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Look at me.
Victor.
You know somebody around here?
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
I can't man, I'm punished!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
C'mon.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
A bad attitude.
Wha'?
Positive.
Probably.  One of the many.
You gotta girLfrLend?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
Like when?
Fletch...
What, the heat here?
Can I get you something?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
That's it?
I guess not.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Course he has. That's his wife.
Of course they are.
Right.
Yeah. Maybe.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Cute thing.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
I bet you do.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
I saved his life during the war.
You saw a forgery.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't tell me I can't --
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
This morning.
Uh, almost.
I never read the paper.
Looks great.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I want something I can print!
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Forget it.
Please.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Great pipes.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Spooky.  I'll process her.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Make eye contact when you say that.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
How much?
You gave it to the girls for one.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
What?
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Ye-ah.
Why have you come to my planet?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Okay.  'B-y-e!
The point?
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Fuck me...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
No - no.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
What?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did they follow you?
It's your problem.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
When ya go back on?
Who's on him?
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
The greaser with the blonde.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
What I know is what I told you.
I'll go find Hayes.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
The usual.
Do you know how much I love you?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Do you know where I found this?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Queens, New York.
This afternoon?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
Johnny...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Nah, I gave it up.
But you're not...you're not still here.
October 12, 1969.
I'm glad.
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
John, he's got my driver's license.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I'll think of something.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Sure.
Chuck... look.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
I don't know.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You promised you'd never ask me.
My whole world.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Alright, alright.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Better call an ambulance first.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Why?
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
No more.
Who ya calling?
But what I get scared again?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Please don't do anything crazy.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Do you have to ask?
So's he and he knows it.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Okay.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I'm literally going to kill you!
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
He bought you that?
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
And you'll never do it again.
We have to get off this ship!!
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Am I? Let's find out.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
What about not-so-great writers?
Really?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Is the ship going to sink??
Very big.
Very bad today.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
That's where I peed.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
It's just a review.
I think we Nought to wait.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Unbelievable.
What are you talking about?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
She is kicking you out.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm not sure.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
I'd forgotten that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Washed away.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Because faith is rewarded.
Why does it matter?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Postpone. We have every right.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
Burnt sienna.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Someone waiting for you?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Are you sure?
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Well, we shall try.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
I thought you were against fighting.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
You will respect the law.
I hope not.
Hm.  Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
That's when you take advantage.
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
From what budget?
Where do we start?
Where did you get this?
Often.
Jerome--?
Six one.
He's too tall.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
German.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
You had to be a right-hander.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Is that all?
Good choice.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Again?
Antonio, the choir...
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Last night?  I was at home.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Friend?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Better than old times.
Sure.
Really?
Really.
Yeah... I know.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Do it my way.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
He must have.
I'll bet you can.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
I didn't mean police.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Yeah.
We walk.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
All right. Shells?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Dillinger got killed.
That's what I want.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You got it.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
That right?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
How'd it happen, then?
I don't know. That's all I was told.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Nicer than most.
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
It's the truth.
Do you?
Oh, do you?
No, do you really?
Really?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
And what was that?
You sure about that?
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
How many?
I'm staying with a friend.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Is he staying the night?
You don't look it.
I'll call the police.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
What about Keith?
Think about it.
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Yes.
I have to. Things to see to.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
Yes.
No.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
Starting up.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Did you?
What did you say?
You're actually talking about this?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Yes.
Yes.  I'm sure.
That's ridiculous.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
That's...
Were the leads insured?
No.
We had a robbery. 
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
The leads come in, I'll let...
I don't want to go to lunch.
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Not lately it isn't.
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
...ah, fuck this...
Twenty percent.
Alright.
I have to go... 
Somebody broke in.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Mmm.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
What?
I...
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Abso...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
And did they steal the contracts...?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
What does that mean?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Kenilw...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
I wanted to speak with you about...
Uh...
Oh!  For the magazine...
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
Yest...
No, Jim.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You going to turn State's?
Fuck the Machine.
Guess who?
Have a good trip.
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
I have the stuff from last year's...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I'm not hungry.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Beautiful.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Yes.
I can't let him down.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Is he related to the witness?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Michael.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Except the President of the United States.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
I want you to settle on their terms.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
I'm talking about Italians!
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Fuck you.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
It never crossed your mind?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
You liked it too.
You mean us?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You did not know?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Your family ate dripping?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
Did you now?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What way might that be?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Not at the moment.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Neither of us really belongs here.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Never gave it much thought.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You're planning a trip?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
All right.
You told me to get you up, asshole.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
She is beautiful.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Of course.
You didn't?
My monsters?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What kind of job... ?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Who do you think?
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You got no choice. It's over.
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You know my back.
Kip.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Cadillac.
Good.
We're partners here --
Donny-nothin'!
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Peugot convertible ...
You know where the others are?
Dignity...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
oh.
You getting my checks ... ?
We'll take it.
Hello, Memphis --
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
"Shadow games?"
What era was that -- ?
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
I left town. I didn't leave you.
That what you want?
Okay.
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
What's that?
Bench seats.
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
How come ... ?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
I'm in construction.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Son of a bitch.
Jezuz Christ!
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Paulie was just talking about him.
Jimmy.
We did it.  We did it.
Done.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
You're some fucking jerk.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
What kind of person doesn't call?
What are we gonna do up there?
Fuck you.
I don't know yet.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Next week.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Gone.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
It's a way outta here.
Why didn't you yoke him?
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
History.
Good, it was all right.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Hey fuck you.
Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
An integer.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
Who proved the theorem.
Good to see you.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
I don't know. India maybe.
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
You're right. I know.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Oh.
No.
What is?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
How'd it go?
Why not?
Haven't called her.
Yeah.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Where were you?
You're kiddin' me.
What?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Yeah.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It sure ain't good.
I know.
I know, I know...
Good luck.
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
What?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
I've never seen your place.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, I'm sure.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
Then what are you afraid of?
At least you have a mother.
I'm not honest?
No, you don't want to hear that.
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
But ain't no reason--
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
People done it. If they could, we could.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Which way is House 25?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Been out travelin' around?
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
I never heard nothin' about it.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
What you figger to do?
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Get to what?
I stay in my own yard.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Hush!
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Okay. I be back a little later.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
Whatsa matter?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I never--
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Yes I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I want to be an actor.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad television.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Yes.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Jesus Christ!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Come on.
This is me breating.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
I get it.
This?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
I'll pay.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
See you next week.
Jim?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Of course you will.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
You're leaving me hanging here...
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Wow.
I'm a professional killer.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
You lived in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
I am comfortable.
Annie!
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
No, you just act like you do.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
My period.
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
I should be in by two.
Riding with Judith.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, let me go.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Do you? Do you really?
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
About what?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Of course not.
We should be fine, then.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
What does she do?
I don't know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
No!
I just could never say it!
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
We still have a way to go.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Alright sir.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Cereal.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Thank you!
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
I have to tell you something.
I'll make it up to you!
How?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Congratulations.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
You're late.
So?
This morning.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I do.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Like a sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
What?
Coming.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Just do it.
Hi Jamie.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Be here in a minute.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
What?
Why did you hang up on me?
Of course.
Sure, see you later.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I don't know.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I want to stay here and watch this.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
I'll be here.
Could have...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Totally.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
What did he look like?
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Thorazin.
Uh --
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Well...
Yes.
This time I really think I have something.
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
And it's just in one ear?
Like what?
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
I'm...all right.
He's got like six gold records.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Lee... uh...
I didn't sleep all night.
I know it isn't.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
No!
You're not lost.
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
I can't take this anymore.
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Like-- 
Oh, me, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Yeah.
Thanks, thanks.
Football!
Wow!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Yeah.
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Well-well, like what?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
God!
...in a really horrible way.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, you can tell me.
No, I haven't.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh!
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Okay.
...which I did not get.
A reward for what?
...I was <u>working</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
I'm looking for...
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...are they hard to get?
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
No.  And...
The children...?
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
No, no, of course not.
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
For a consideration.
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
What'd you say, hon...?
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
...who say...?
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...might I make a suggestion...?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Then we cannot go.
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
...what did you want? 
The shape of a Three.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...I feel that...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
What is your point?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
...why?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
You guys have been so colossal...
Your Secret admirer?
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?

Hey, don't run away now.
You're beautiful.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
All right.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Chick-en.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
May<u>be</u>.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
What's that?

I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.

I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.

I don't wanna be in bloody school!
You have to let me go!

I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
This . . .
That idiot boarder?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Okay so... what's the safest place?
I understand, I think. Other women?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
What?
What's the occasion?
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
What?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Uh... eighty two?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Wow you are out of it.  
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I surrender...
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Try stupid.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
LaPlante!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
You mean John Bubber?
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Underbelly!
Lie, you mean...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Were you in it?  In the war?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Vietnam!
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
LaPlante!
That too.
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Who?
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Any particular brand?
And the rent is okay?
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
Right.
Yeah, that was easy.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Bye, Neil!
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.
Holly -- that's not so.
So you don't have anything concrete?
And?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Just reduced.
It's fun.
Right over here.
Uh huh.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
You?
I hear you.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
That's all?
For what?
No -- I will.
She's a treasure she is.
Agreed.
How?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Then take me with you.
Are you a cop?
Because it's my name.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why?
I've seen it.
It will end tonight.
Sounds very -- normal.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
What do you want to do?
The best.
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
I guess not.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
It's about Mars --
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
There is no way out.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Let me come get him.
My father.
Use more ice.
Keeps to himself, more like.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
You'd better be kidding.
What I want is to help my father.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Yes.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Go.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Go, Mickey.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
What do you want?
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Leave it to me.
How many in your family?
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
What's happening?
Excuse me, Colonel.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The United Nations are still here.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I committed no war crimes.
You will tell them the truth.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Very soon.
I saw the sign.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
He wants your wisdom.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
What!
Give him time.
We have been abandoned.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
In Ruhengeri?
Why?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
It was substantial.
I want to know.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Thank you, sir.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
Not yet.
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Excuse me?
-- what was he doing here?
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
The...Fourth of July.
Poor Mr. Price --
Up here --
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
Prove it how?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
He's gotta still be down here.
Then who are they?
You're hurting me.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- wit...nesses --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- my loss --
What?
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
Excuse me?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Something....happened --
Suppose not.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
How's your arm?
Good-bye.
She talks to me.
What about all my other stuff?
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
You didn't think much about that before.
Whatever you say.
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
I don't know what I'm saying.
Aubrey!
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
I'm ok.
What about the other five percent?
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what is ... this frozen moment?
What can we do?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
Taken what?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
You gonna buy?
Uh-huh.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
A prize?  For what?
I'm sorry.
Unh-unh.
Yes.
Fuck you!
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Okay.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I'm going to find out.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Never, why do you ask?
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Trust Leonardo....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Like a "cat", one could say.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
We're here to say, your government was right.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
Why George, you big softie...
With a little jazz.
He didn't look unhappy!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
I myself --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
I'm sure I --
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
You don't say.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Forty-eight years...
This you're familia' with.
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
But, Buzz --
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
-- tough titty toenails!
Yeah?
You --
Hmmm.
Not even behind your back?
Get your feet off that desk.
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Damnit, where's my car!
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
There's one in every story.
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
I'm afraid so.
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Wait. I want to listen.
That doesn't sound like him.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I often do.
I love Fort Holland.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Help me? How?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Yeah, good.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
You want to go?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
You go dry off now.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
See for yourself.
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
A key party?
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Let me.
Well, we can talk about it.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Mom. Are you ok?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes.
That's right.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
See ya.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Truly? Do speak.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Out.
Wendy!
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
What time is it?
Mikey was looking for you.
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about him...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Okay.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
I know.
Byrd's dead.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
That's right.
You know what about.
What did he look like?
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
You're not missing much.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
What was it?
But we work so well together...
This an accident, Walter?
No back-up.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Listen to me.
That's what the one who made me said.
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Louis, I swear I did not.
Stop her Louis!
What have you done?
He'll never let us go.
Yes...
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Be still!
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
But how do you know?
As did the one who made me.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I know. Let her alone.
What are you saying?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You loved your wife, surely.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
And you know what you ask for?
My daughter...
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Not me...no way...
Some.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
I've got to see.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
You know me to well.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
It's...him.
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Why?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
No. I shot him.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
It was, the plague
That your father and I ——
Really, this is idiotic!
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
It is for that he hates me.
Who?
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Our clothes are dry.
Zuzu's petals.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Where's Mary?
I'm not supposed to tell.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
When'd you see him last?
Well, what happened to you?
Want to give my flower a drink.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Goodbye, Sam.
I'm all right.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Oh, stop that grunting.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
You're not paid to be a canary.
No, sir.
Aw, forget it.
No. No.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
I hope it works.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Holy mackerel!
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
In that place?
Uh-huh.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Yeah, just started.
George, darling! Where have you been?
You have no idea what happened . . .
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
You going to the lighthouse?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
You're betting what you already got.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You bet.  Hang on....
Can you get us a line?
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Oh.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
You don't make enough.
Is there one in these waters?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Why?
Right.
Home it is.
Better yet.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
No.
Do you?
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I'll give notice.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
What for?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Hiya yourself.
Now I really want to see it.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Next week.
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
You got it.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Is there something I don't know about?
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Take me.
I want to go with you!
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
I can get it.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Hope I make it through both.
You will.  I'll see to it.
And what else is bothering you?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
They just wanted to say hello.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Nothing.
And leave me down here???
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
What's that?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Me, too.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I like it when they wake up.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
He's missing.
How you doing, Kelly?
You like Florida?
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
It's okay, Sean.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's large enough...
That's impossible.
So was Dad.
Gee, it's good to see you!
He was doing his job....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Off....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I won't....
Thank you....
Thanks for the consultation....
Mother....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm not going to quit now....
You're not a pain in the ass....
Trying to write our report....
There's nothing to worry about....
Why'd you take the boat?
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I don't know how....
A big one....
You sure you know how to do this.
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Oh, boy....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
They won't fight with me....
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
When I got the grant.....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Just trying to be helpful....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
No way....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Anything to do before I go home?
I'll take care of it.
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Only me and Mom ..
I think you're here all day.
Not too good in daylight ..
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
What do you mean, Ross?
Because I dislike her too much ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
That's just what I wanna find out.
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
No.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Wrong cabinet.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
What color was it?
Ross told me.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
I wanna be near you ...
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
A derelict.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Look, I don't want a --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
No.
Still going.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
You're imagining it.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
No no, I know --
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
We are?
It's all going to work.
Sure.
Oh good.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Will you marry me?
What --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Ten seconds, Rod.
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Yes.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
I'm asking you a question --
I think so.
Fine.
Oh no -- _ 14.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
You'll lose.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Can you be quiet?
One way to find out.
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
He says it's a bad idea!
So do you.
No, Dr. Grant says...
We have to help him.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
Who's that?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Are you sure?
Why?
Back out! Move!
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Good lad.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
You're going too?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, no!
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
The monitors are failing.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
How am I supposed to transport them?
They are?  I'll be damned.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
The what?
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Sattler.
We're out of a job.
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
No, no, no!
What's that?
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
I know, it's very exciting.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Alan?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah - - great.
No.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Fine.
What?  What can we do?
Let's get you out.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
That was great!
Ken, we've been through this...
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
You have a map.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Fuck you.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
He's fucking nuts.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
None of that's true?
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
I know.
Yes.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
I wouldn't put it past him.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
It's gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
I can't imagine you crying.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Native costume?
Why?
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Sorry. 
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
I guess he figured it was better.
Here please.
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
My name's John Klute.
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
How would I remember?
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
No thanks.
Can't you get him?
He never told me.
Well -- she's dead.
Try some other ways. 
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
How?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
What am I supposed to say?
Right back at the start, right?
Go down in my room.
You wanted to, or you are?
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
Two years ago? Sorry.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Yes sir, we know he --
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
Playing.
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
Yeah?
I guess...
I'm sorry.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Dad?
Sure.
Yep.
No, she never did.
No.
What did you do when you were little?
Who will read me my stories?
Your mom.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
And yet you fired him.
Yes.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
You've been living here, in the city?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
What?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Three months.  How can you tell?
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Any prospects?
No.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Got it.
Slow down...Slow down...
Yes, Holiness.
Are you, General?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
I will not approve it.
General Chiang.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Do I have money?
No. Not very big.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What do you think?
You decide.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
Too young?
Like my mother.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
The more he thrashes, the better.
Just those two.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
<u>Hector</u>.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Eh.  Fuck it.
They could try to tranq him on land.
What?
That's probably good.
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Thank you.
They look like they're jumping.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
Did he say anything?
Seconds.  Three, four.
What kind of backup do we have?
You threw it at me!!
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<u>Apologize</u>?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
<u>That</u> was a bust.
What?
Look ten feet into the water.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Yes, well...  famished.
I'm not even a field person.
Wild guess.
Kelly--
Shitbutt?
Thanks, Ardelia.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
What girl?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Where?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I understand.
I think we may be, yes.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Where?
Sewing...
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Who killed your patient?
Yes.
A moth... How did you predict that?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Yes, miss.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Let us go, miss.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
My letter...
And by sea!
"Some"?
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
I don't understand!
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
For Munro children?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
I'm not a doctor.
Why Sixpack?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Just get in yours!
Still...you did the right thing.
Maybe they already have.
Where's Jones?
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Russian.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Under there?
I'm going to try to remove it.
Like a leech.
How is he?
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
I'll think of something, don't worry.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
I am not fucking interested.
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Right as rain.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
A hundred grand.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I will loan you the money.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
And that does include the amp?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Seven hundred each.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
At what, exactly?
What about all the gear?
Six.
Twelve.
How many feet?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
What do you mean?
So?
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Yes, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Skinny?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
Just wondering.
If it's too late--
But they were Indians themselves.
Didn't have a father?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey--
Seriously.
We been through this before--
Take that pair over in the corner--
Have we had trouble there before?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Why would you want to do that?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
Seems like we have another one every week.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
--Santiago.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
No. Is he sick?
Enough with the clothes--
How come?
Three months.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Amado.
So what are we gonna do about this?
More, I hope.
Like your story is over.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Uh-huh.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Gotta be in person.
Oh.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
You sell much out here?
They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Who is he?
Why?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
He won't.
I could scoop them out.
Will you come to him on your knees?
He's with us... He's with us...
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Do you?
You haven't seen anything yet.
You didn't marry him for love.
That's my business. Harry.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
He taught all this to Swann?
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer--
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
Harry-?
... they believe you.
--vanished.
Fuck you.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Probably.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
I tried to pay you off.
Was that Swann's idea?
Help me.
I won't say anything.
What's her problem?
Not much.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Not the Walter Wilder?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
For an introduction.
Well... nobody.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Have you been in?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
How the fuck do you do that?
Yes.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
You don't think I've got it to give?
No!
Binding you.
Yes.
Yes.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
You'll do it?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
No.
Hi, Charlie.
Charlotte, who?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
No, its easy.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Oh.
But, I'm mean.
You are.
Four.
You think so?
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Well, I mean it more now.
Yes.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
It's just carpet.
Not all that pasta.
It's ok.
That's ok.
Ok.
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Good...I'm tired.
I got some hair stuff.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Sure.
Ok, bye.
What happened?
I don't know.  What are they?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
I think I should join you.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He will.  He has great faith.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
How many weeks are you honey/
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
I didn't know what else to do...
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I do.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
Peter, please...
Please, the children.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
What do you mean?
You have to say that.
What did he say to you in French?
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Nice suit.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
What do you mean by that?
How're you doin' today?
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Maybe she is.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Careful.
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
You were trying to make me look bad.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
You do act different.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Hey.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
I know, right?
What'd it say?
So you're gonna act salty all night?
My court, I go first.
She understands.
Why not?
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
You want to go talk?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Getting there.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Wrong.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So?
Business folks.
Nona, please.
Yeah.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Sorry.  You okay?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
No.
You ok?
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Does this sound weird?
Brain and Lung.
It's a helluva disease.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
No.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
You wanna make a deal with me?
I'm sorry.
ok.
You don't know how crazy I am.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Just say no.
please, what is it, please --
Cynthia?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
You mind your own bussines.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Braces.
Braces?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Yeah.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
She loves you.
...cocksucker....
You got it.
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
Graduation?
Twelve.
....getthat on the tv....there...
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And your father?
Not a problem.
And "Frank?"
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
...are you Phil...?
yeah.
I AM CALM.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
Did your wife find out?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
What happend to you?
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
-- did she talk to you?
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I'll answer anything.
How long with Ellen?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
But you can't say....
No they don't --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Phone number.
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
Yeah.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Yes.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
I am preparing for a ball!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
He who is not with us is against us.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
And people close to him, who --
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Three days.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
But -- but --
Pull them back!
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
I heard your playing.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Your mother's.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Forgive?!
... The ball... Continue.
I must insist, Sire.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Sire, I --
... Nothing.
Raoul... is in love...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
So what?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Don't worry -
Yeah...
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
What?  Wait a minute -
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Found what?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Jesus, man...
I killed them.
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Book code?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Read it.
'You're very beautiful.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
What is it?
Personal ads?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
When are you coming back?
How do I know?!
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
This is our boy...!
What?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No. Reba...?
Who?
Francis...?
The Tooth...
No.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Why do you think I called?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
He only bit women so far, right?
No.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Blue is cold.
I remember.
That's not true.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
You going back down to Florida after?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
I can't thank you enough, I...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I figured I'd ask you...
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Yes.
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
I don't have one right now.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
You got it.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Ten.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Hi... am I late?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
GET OFF!
You're a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
They're asking for it.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
It's working for Elvis.
Goals are important.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
So your name's not Gorsky.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
What?
Two grand.
Right...
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
How many were there?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
We have no choice.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
The agents --
It's an honor.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
What truth?
Be what?  Be real?
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Honestly?  I don't know.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
Is it?
Yes.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
We can't leave him!
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
What do they want?
What are you talking about?
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
I'll be all right.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Can't we come with you?
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Panther!  Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Didn't show up.
Did you see them run!
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Don't be smart.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
We'll be here.
Whatever.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
All right.
What was it?
Nothing.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Maybe, who knows.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
Yeah, I think so.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You could say that.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
But it's your birthday.
A name?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Who's Annie?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Drew, you're out of line.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Why yes, thank you.
"Death and Taxes"?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Me, too.
What?!
What do you mean?
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
How nice for you both.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
As much as Joe's?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I know.  Gum up the works.
What you then?
Some spot you pick.
I am.
Don' need you okayin'.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Oh yes, I do.
But she loves you?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
I don't mind --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
-- Yes?
You think so?
Thank you.
Closer than that.
Good morning, Bill.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Sounds fair enough.
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
Not this.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
I guess...
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Well, they're mine now.
Does she know where she's going?
And we're very grateful.
Thank you.
I do?  How long will you be staying?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I don't!
What you were talking about.
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
'The one' to do what?
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
Drew told me.
You're only six-five once.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Aw, you're tough.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Joe?
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
I'm having a helluva time.
Why not?
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Yeah?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
A cop?
Don't say anything else.
Take the money and walk away!
You did explain, Lenny.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Sorry.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
So I just take your word?
Your wife?
And? 
Yeah?
Did you?
No!
How?
About your whore of a wife?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Who?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
From who?
What sort of questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Somehow, I'll know!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
And...?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
I dance...
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Stevens?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
On my way back...
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
No.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
I would never doubt you.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
We don't know.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Have faith.
Yeah.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
I know. Scribbage!
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Oh hell, forget it.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
Yeah.
I'm going to Florida.
You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Gonna be like money from home.
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.
No. You got it.
Get lost.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Getchmis...?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Ziat!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Shit.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Sixty?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Something like that. Cigarette?
How much did you figure to make?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
...She was on the plane.
Twelve years.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Seven years...
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Oh we... we...
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You're right.
Mr. Yesil.
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
What do you-?
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
Across both tracks!!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
You the bug lady, right?
That's it?
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
Thank you.
Sounds good.
How long...?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
I'm...
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
C'mere, I'll show you.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
It's perfect.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It will.
Just from his agent.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
There's that spice again.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Did they win?
Here it is.  Very first copy.
That'd be a first.
Great.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
From her point of view or mine?
How grateful?
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
What else?
To do what?
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
What are you talking about?
What was the top bid?
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Far right.
- this is very disconerting..
Do what?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Listen to what?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Of what?
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
I'll muddle through.
Ethan, tell me -
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
May take a little time.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Who is "they?"
Who is they, who is they?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Information.
What kind?
It's quite out of the question.
Mm - Hmmm...
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
What about Job?
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
Always.
What problem?
I guess.
Why not?
He's our guy.
Can you lose him?
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Good luck.
Jack...that's spying.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
You look tired.
He did?
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
Good morning, Lucy.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
No.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I've got you.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It makes you look like an angel.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm here!
That's right.
I'm afraid of who I am.
I'm freezing to death.
No. I'm gonna wait.
What!
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
This is a good suit.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Did he tell her?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What's the matter with him?
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
He should pay.
I came right from the airport.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
You don't know where Loretta is?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
Do you have a girlfriend?
Are you sure?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Yes.
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Marriage is happy news.
Oh.
You see that moon last night?
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Did you dress her up like this?
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Please!
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Well, who is your lord?
NI!   NI!
'Tis but a scratch.
What?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
There.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
Blue.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
I think I could pull through, sir.
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Rather what?
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
I was saved at the last minute.
No.  Until I come and get him.
... and you'll come and get him.
Leaving the room.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Just you ...
The Prince ... ?
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Sir Galahad!!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Camelot ...
You are in great peril.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
I don't think I was.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Ector.
Back to your bed!  At once!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
I didn't.
Seventy a year.
What?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You watch your tongue.
Aye.
Be careful who sees it.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
My own.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
If you hunt, you kill.
Oh.
This is the top.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
You can't know that for sure.
Who?
Yes.
Whom?
The same, your Majesty.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Of course, at once.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
What?!
We can't...
My house.  I want to try something.
It's already out.
I don't know.
What are you going to do?
Everything.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
I know.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Yes...but...how did you...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
So how do I start?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
They fired everyone.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
The Cowboy??
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
You gotta be kidding?
Will you meet with him?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Yeah.
Whatever.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Okay.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
You don't remember anything else?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
No... but...
Yes, Sir.
This Denny's.
Go ahead.
I had a dream about this place.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Pick with expediency !
No one has a gun to your head.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I don't know.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Is this really the time ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Why ?
Look...
Got it.
Trust is earned not given away.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He's been expecting you.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
I meant him.
As appealing as that sounds...
What ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Oh, just put it over there.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Could you hold on for a second? 
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Of course.
Totally.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I've got something better.
More than anything in the world.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
Happy hunting.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
I think it's cool.
And I thought I was weird.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
DON'T!!!
Owh...
Here's Judy Garland!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
He's an undertaker.
Yeah?
What's it for?
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
She'll be all right baby.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
He's so tiny.
He's a great poet.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
I'm impressed.
No.
What Hurts Vada?
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I wrote that.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Okay.
I'll second that.
You can get the general idea...
I don't know which ball's mine.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Why not?
Do you miss her?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh come on.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
That's really cool.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
He won't give it to me.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Hi.
See food!
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Liverpool?
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
What do you think it's like?
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
What do you want it for anyway?
But I have my clothes on!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I don't like her.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.
Umm, Ummmmm
Something like that.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I was gonna predict that.
I've missed a step.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
I just don't want to freak him out.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
It doesn't say th...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
... Thomas, yeh.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Quite the little eccentric.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for that.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
And your point?
Oh, yeah.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
You got a real good memory, Star.
Come on.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
What's wrong honey.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What?
What did you say your name was?
She's fine.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Whose word?
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
I said 'no!'
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
What!
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Your brother?
What is a turkey shoot.
I'm not really a musician.
Suits me.
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
We don't mess with accessories.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When did you start singing?
I'm not sure. Where?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I've got a gig tonight.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Wrong.
Car pool?
That's what you said before.
Linnea?
Money's no object.
Out.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
I know a couple.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
What did you think then?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
When have they ever been right?
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
I do, too.
Rockin'!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Why?
But you'll never be whole again.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
And me.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Okay.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Okay.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
That's right.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
What d'you mean?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Don't call them that.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Day work.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
'Round town.
How 'bout the key?
'Bye, Jocko.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Yeah. That's right.
I heard you.
Better get him to a hospital.
No thanks, Lee.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
No, they won't.
Okay.
I guess not.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Right here.
You hate Raoul?
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Of course.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
Very well.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
And then?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
What are you talking about?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
We run. You crack the pattern?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How's the ice?
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
Why should I want to meet him.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What the fuck... are you serious?
Go ahead...
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
They'll cut you down.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Anita, remember espadrilles?

No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wings?
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A--flack jacket.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
What if I say no?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
My sword.
But I'm not a penguin.
I'm Rob's prom date.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
You're twenty-three years old!
Rufus?
I know.
Sorry. Forgetful.
I love the way she writes.
Sure, why?
Thank you.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Thanks. So do you.
Yeah, I have.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Duh.
Well, a ball player.
Lock.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Just out for a while.
No.  Upstairs.
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
He'll die with me!
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Ah, nothing.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
About not finding any bogey men?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
What is it?
Oh, Jesse...
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
You okay?
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Okay, I guess.
Okay...thanks.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
Yeah, but I was really not good.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Fuck off.
Restless.  Very restless.
Call me Nancy.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
Try me.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
No...
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Well, they can be.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Nothing.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
This is the place.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Well, get a message through to him too.
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Who was Gilda?
Oh.
That's spectacularly unfair.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Thank you.  Shall I...
What's the thing?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Does the girl have a name?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Yes.
The movie star?
Do you want to stay?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
It was good.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Sort of.
Yes.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
On this ward?
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
No, it was irresponsible!
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Yeah, kid?
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?
Yeah, Mack?
Me, too...
A pecking party?
Lobotomy?
So why are you talking to him?
What for?
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
No!
Let me see your hand!
Can you borrow me a dime?
That's a dime, Martini.
He is!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
I see...
I don't, Doc...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Are you a doctor?
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Okay. Who else?
You's better believe it, brother!
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
What?
Huh?
Asshole.
How 'bout twenty?
You're a witness, Doc!
Yes, Miss Ratched!
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Buona notte.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
But, Faith--
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Thanks.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
You are leaving, aren't you?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Because-- I want you to be happy.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
What?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
How about the other one?  His friend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
It's still the new year...
Maybe.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
You think he misses me at all?
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Larry bought himself cologne?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
What if he doesn't like me?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
What about Larry?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Larry, did you rent a car?
Kate.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She's not here.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
In a minute.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
What the hell!!!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Thanks anyway.
I don't know.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
But that's living like an animal—
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
I know... I know... .
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
Terry, for God's sake.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
But you've got to listen to me.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
What did you say?
But you still hold out for silence?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Down to the wire?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
I'm just resting my feet.
I told you lay off.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Be sure they got enough water.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
No?
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
First things first.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Forty-five bills.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
A symbol, Master.
As you wish, Master
I understand, Master
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
He didn't want me to.
Who are you?
Yes.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
You better come see this.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Two hours.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
What?
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
What'd you talk about?
And what happened to Carl?
You'll have to ask him.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Wait, I know him --okay?
I bet.  How much?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
The fuck you talking about?
Hey.  You learn from doing.
Someone down here?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
Buddy.  That's his given name?
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
We still talk, though.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Really.
Shit...
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why not?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
A girl.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
I'm just going to the bathroom.
You know what I mean.
In the trunk?
I don't know...
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Of course not.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
And so now you're off to Glades.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Why's that?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
I <i>was</i>...
What do you want?
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
What'd I say?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
That's how you score now?
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Red...Strange?
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
He did.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Home of the brave.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
...He said that?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
From the air?
Thank you, Sir.
Bombers.
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
Respect.
I was hoping to meet him.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
He does?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Charlie? Was I dead?
I'll just set it right here.
Yes, sir. Trust is a two—way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Evelyn, take her to her room!
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm just happy to see you.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You have an incredible memory.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
I don't know.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
What will they be made of?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
It's been a few years.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
He pissed me off.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
Why not?
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
A reaction to AZT...
I am relaxed.
You're not smiling.
Drew!
Maybe you should think about it.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Uh, yeah.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
As in, the vegetable?
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Beckett?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
No. I didn't.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What do you love about it?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
In some situations.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Objection.
Were you recently promoted?
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
I might.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Great.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Any women on board?
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Charles...
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
'Mean the whispers?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
As fast as you can.
We can't make it.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
But they...they could still be....
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Hey, who?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
25 kilos each, huh?
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Never said you were a hype, either.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
You mean....
You <u>don't</u> see.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Looks clear.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Nice embellishment.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
I apologize.
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Do you have any weapons?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
What's so special about him?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
You didn't think so then.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
None at all.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
What is it?
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
The Hunt Club.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
A hearing.
Second from the left.
Yes.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Yeah?
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
What you got there - beers?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?

Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
If I change my mind.
How do you do?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
There's one less tonight.
He got in here how?
Nice of him.
That's all there is.
Quarter after one. Why?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
From you, I like it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
They're going to arrest me.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Killaine...
Frozen.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
There isn't anything you can do.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
To do what?
I can't answer that.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
Martini.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I wouldn't know.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Would that make me a heel?
Doesn't answer the question.
Information.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Passkey?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You nasty, sardonic--
Convenient, isn't it?
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Men like you don't need orders.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
So it seems Sergeant.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
I think so.
Should be over there.
You can find out.
Well.  What about it?
So?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Not if it clears the air.
And if you didn't believe me?
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Who?
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
He's all right, the professor.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nonsense.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Hold those rights.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
I'm waiting for your mother.
They don't count.
What would you call it?
U-huh.
She said that?
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
You do it... you first!
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
I say when it's over!
SHIT!!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Surf conditions okay?
What?
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
What that?
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Who cares!
What do you mean?
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Right behind you.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
The best friend I ever had.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Sure.  For five bucks.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What's your name, lover.
What?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Can I have some chips?
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Fair enough.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
You liked the guy, though.
I have work to do.
Was someone rude to you?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Shush.  Of course you can.
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It felt good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Yes...
Doing what?
You're being ridiculous.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Who did you think?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
You bullshittin' me?
Oooh, I love those.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Steak spoon! 
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Of course.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
As you wish.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Did you say, "I do"?
Who's Guilder?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
True!
How many could you handle?
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Right, right, sorry.
What?
I hope we win...
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Not yet.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
That would be inconceivable.
What?
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Oh, have it your way.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Good. Then pour the wine.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"I want to croon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Good, what is it?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You're going to jump on me.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Who wrote it?
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
We swear it!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Nice girl.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Or arrived with her.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I live there. Alone.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
A lot?
And the police haven't been able to...
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
A good reason, I suppose.
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
It's been three.
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
An hour! Or less!
You'll never find it.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Who's he?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
You're not.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
What makes you sound so certain?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Bates.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
For what?
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm thinking of it.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Is anything wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
I didn't think so.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
A voice ...
What did it say?
No!  Good night!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Are you giving me this straight?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Let it go.
What do you mean?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
No, sir. About three months ago.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
Cry-baby?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Fire insurance!
He can't hear you.
What was her name?  The one I met.
Okay.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Where is she?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
I know, Mother.
But who were they?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Well, some fiend might.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yeah.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
How did the rabbits kill him?
I do, too!
Yeah, he's still up there.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out.
No.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Okay.
I can't see, let me see...
Boy! Wow!
So am I.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Yeah, they're in the snow.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Of course.
What?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Is she all right?
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Honey, please...
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
What?
Your baby?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
But... I love him.  I do...
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
You think it's that good?
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
What... ?
Abe Lincoln...
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Save it.  Just go.
Relax.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Clench your teeth.
What day is it?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Bullshit.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
No, but it should.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
General Jim Beam, then.
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Maybe.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
You can't be serious.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You know... you could say thank you.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
No you're not.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Dead.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Come again... ?
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Billy!  Billy!
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
Yoda will always be with you.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Jabba's palace.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good, I hate long waits.
Proper?!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Yes.
Yes or no will do.
Certainly not!
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Makes you cry
Was all I had to say
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh, lucky him.
...Guess.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Don't tease me.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
It did.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
That so.
Paulie!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
Get that doctor.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
No, man, it's very smart.
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Don't like yours neither.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
This a con?
Few minutes?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
That's it, I'm broke.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
...What?
Yeah.
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
Ain't they?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
What's happened is freak luck.
Freak luck for sure.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Creed's great.
'Bout what?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Ya always in a bad mood --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Whatta these guys want?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Shoulda guessed.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Ask her...
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
No...
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
He's right here in the...
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
So's the job.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Aah!
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Yeah, that's better.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon?  Noooo.
No, it's not.
I rest my case.
Yeah?
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Have patience!
Romeo will answer it?
The what?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
[Within] Juliet!
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
A most courteous exposition.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
NO! Mercutio!
Is she a Capulet?
What?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Not to me, you know that.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Don't do it, Sam!
I think not.  After you...
What do you mean?
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
But first you have something to take care of?
I didn't expect that he would.
Did he bring that with him?
Coordinate what?
Jujitsu.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Well I ain't a cop.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Yes.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You would have done that?
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
Do you have a good answer?
Finish it!
Nothing...
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gone.  Destroyed.
You put everything on the line because you...
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Well someone's gonna find them.
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
Rock solid.
My point, well...
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
None of us like it!
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
I don't know.  My friends...
I swear to you, it's true...
What did he buy?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Why would someone do that?
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Uh...C?
Sure.
A lot of men come in here?
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
That hasn't stopped you before.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne -
Hi.
There was more than that.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Two-hundred thousand!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Carter, would I lie to you?
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
Try to land on your feet.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
You're not very good at this, are you?
Good at what?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
What?
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He'll be back soon.
What did you say?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Take it!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Are you serious?
Who's Benjamin?
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
No problem.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
This money is evidence.
How do I know I can trust you?
Any leads?
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
This is pathetic.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
A little.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Yes, I know this song.
Yes, I think so.
Going into the restaurant.
I am from outa town.
No...what?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
That's what you were supposed to be!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Or somethin'.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Ambassador Han.
I want to speak with my daughter!
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Maintain eye contact.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
"Sink the putt."
"Nothing but net."
His hair... any color.
No.  No, you didn't.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Then come for dinner.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, I will.
That must have made you proud.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You have one?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
Without oxygen...
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Yes I do!
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
So am I.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
It's probably because you got him fired.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Quick.  Very quick.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Nope.
Walter, I'd love to --
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
-- it was a betrayal.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
What?
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
I know.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
But he saw you, right?
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I know.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
What?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
No.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
It's Y. O. H.
Your only hope.
You're right.  You better hope so.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
What was?
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Who is Annie?
This conversation is finished.
Did not.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
No.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What about camping?
I'm sorry --
You're kidding --
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
He'll have it good. Some day.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Can be what?
Backward.
A meeting?
Be still ...
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
That's it?
Are you Australian?
Yeah.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I'll see you tonight.
Then leave.
You don't understand.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
That's long enough to get out of town.
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Lead the way.
You don't say.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
Make me an offer.
Big Bill
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
When?
I thought you'd be happy.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
What?!
That would be me.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
You mean the menacing red car?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Don't we always take good care of you?
But, sir...I...I...
Spit it out, Captain.
No kidding.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Yep.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Wade?
Keep trying.
White-walls?
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
Did he see any sign of them?
You don't count.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Sure, you got one?
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Three for three.
How about you take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Bits and pieces.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's always a bright side.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
See to it.
Alright, come with me.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Yeah?  So?
We know.
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
No, no he's not.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I dream about it.
I can put that together.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
I love you too honey.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad.
Crash paranoia.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
You're going.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
I'm so ashamed dad.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
So you're monumentally busy?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Okay, bye, I will.
What did you say?
Friends with potential.
I'm doing alright.
No.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
No, we don't have to say it.
It sounded like you did.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
What?
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Good to know.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Man, you're bringing me down!
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
Hang tough, Lloyd.
Hey.
What?
I was just going to kind of move around.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you too.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
I'm talking to a clerk.
Klaus Tauber.
War.
It's up to you.
In Breslau.
They're mine!
It's bad business.
You asked for shoe polish.
There's nothing in the stores.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Ah, yes.
And killing.
More.
Yes.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You did so much.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
That's okay.
What if I said goodbye?
I thought you were going to the mixer?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Why don't you ask them?
You freakin?
It's under control.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Until now.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Tails.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
C'mon. Let's go.
No, wait here.
No, wait...
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Where you going?
Do you work for her now?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Thanks.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Excuse me?
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Is that a threat?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
They've got her!
What about me?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Someone stole Sid's file?
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
Bitch.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
What are you talking about?
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
What are you doing here?
Oh it did?
You lost your mom...
Yeah... I think so.
What?
Uh-huh.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
What number is this?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
It happens. Take it easy.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
They'd never make it in time.
Come on, yes you do.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Afraid not.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
About thirty seconds.
I'll send you a copy.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Forget it.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Has his story changed?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Who are you?
Twice.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
So what's his reason?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
It's past seven.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Come on, let's rock.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
No, I haven't heard.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
What the hell's going on?
Why?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
And, why is that?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Shut up!
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
No one yet.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
What about sports?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Totally unrelated victims.
Call an ambulance.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
And so what?
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
How do you know all about this?
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
We have probable cause now.
We had him.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
You do your job...
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Big surprise.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Slut.
Are you absolutely certain?
It's a hard place.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Crime of passion.
How should I know?
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Think she means for us to follow?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Not no more.
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Finish your breakfast...
It wasn't much of a letter...
You crazy?
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Cherry-red Tears.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Hi, darling.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Does this dog here belong to you?
I've killed my husband!
What?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
It's good.
Thank you, Ned.
Yes.
You have the money?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
You're a liar.
No, no. You have a wife, children
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
And his ears.
Yes, but very well.
What happened to Sam?
What do we do now?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
But your voice  Have they dropped?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
But the plague
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Oh. What is your name?
Oh but why "alas?"
It is strange to me, too.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Orsino…good name
How does it?
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
She loves me, Thomas!
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
And her voice? Like lark song?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
I don't have time.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
When are you going to let the police know?
So who's going to do it?
No, not that.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Is that going to be deep enough?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
There was a break-in.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
But there's no --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
Just one thing.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Alex.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
So?
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
For ever and ever.
No, I don't.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
It tastes different.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
It's the only way.
You're frightened.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
What about?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
No.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
No one. I promise.
If I think you're lying --
What?
Exactly what I was --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
I'm not sure --
What guy?
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Did he sound upset?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Look again if you like.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
What?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I don't know.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Your husband?
I don't know. Just a minute...
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Why?
Yeah.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right.
You do know what money's like these days.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I don't know. Probably not.
I'm sure.
Yeah... wow.
The shrink? Many times.
Why not?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
What?
Hey, I don't tell.
Fuckin' A --
-- what?
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
-- ass and legs --
-- we are?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- how did you get here?
-- yeah, this is --
What's gonna happen?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I am?
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Of course I like children.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Could I?
Go where?
When can I talk to you?
Whether or not I'm going.
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Right now?
Neither do I, baby.
Where's your car?
Never mind. Where've you been?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Said what!
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Okay, thanks.
No --
Come on by.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
You do?
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Who were you talking to?
Who do you think I was talking to?
What's that?
Aren't you going to have one?
Does she know about us?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Fine.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Jackie --
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- uhh-huhh...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
No... how long did you say?
Do you have something against traveling?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes, Dad.
Yes?
No, Dad.
Who's Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Try to think what it was.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Talking to Tony.
Where does he go?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Advocaat is it?
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger cook.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
All right, sir.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
What line of work are you in now?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I know it.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Go away.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
shut in together over long periods of time.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Yeah! What is it?
Yeah... sure.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
I think I hear it!
Thanks.  A lot.
This prom is a real drag.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Um, I don't really know this one...
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Tell me about it.
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
A cigarette?
Three years.  Sister.
Really?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Bless you.
It's true!
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
A what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
What do you mean?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Saving you.  Move!
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Yeah, like what?
Oh-huh.
They open a window.
Willy -- hit the lights.
Yes?
He's decent.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
But, Bishop...
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Many have.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
You must have missed your mark.
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
To place it inside its coffin.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
Bring him.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
May we look at them now?
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Not for lack of trying.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
I'm sure I don't know.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Lady Van Tassel...
Small talk.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
There is no such thing as magic.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What?
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What would you have me believe?
Yes, actually.
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Very little.  I must be going...
Turn around.  Now!
The Horseman.  Yes.
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Sure.
Well, I guess it's all good.
About a half a mile I think it is.
It's too big.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Leave.
What do you want, hun?
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
What's all them books?
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I aim to kill you with it.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
I reckon I feel all right.
All right then.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Two people.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Yeah.
All right then.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Is that right?
Yeah.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
I love you, too, Mama.
Me, too.
I ain't got no boy.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I never was no good with history.
Right now?
Ma'am?
That boy wants me to.
Naw, I ain't.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I know.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
It's my birthday.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Forty-one pages.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
I didn't know you took pictures.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Anything good?
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Yeah, like what?
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
For keeps?
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
Sure thing. See you later.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I just want to know where he is.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
And you told your nephew about it?
I figured he had a right to know.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It was just a thought.
What's your offer?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
So what's the time?
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
That's where the what comes in.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
You can't be more specific than that?
Yeah, that's right.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Good thinking.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Have a look.  At nothing.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
I was checking the cables.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
And what do you believe?
You have to wonder.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
And her farmhouse...?
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Bull fiddle.
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
Funny?  In what way?
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
I'll say.
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
Good night, Josephine.
How can we?  We're broke.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
I am.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
What do you think you're doing?
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Anything wrong?
And your head is hot.
I'm not that sick.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Come on, Daphne.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
You don't say.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
I'm not surprised.
Wanna bet?
Why?
Pleased to meet you.
Come one!
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
It's three weeks in Florida -
Because I got some plans -
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Afford it?
Me?
You can't trust those guys.
Every time!
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
You mean - like frigid?
That makes me feel just awful.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good morning.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I don’t think I should be allowed to get married.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Actually, I do.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
You are taking the piss?
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
And you do now?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Crikey.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
What does your gut say?
You’re too good for him.
This happened to you?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Okay.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Not dollars. Pounds.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Meet Nick.
Oh, well, then. It probably won’t work out.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
That does it...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
And so you did your job, right?
Yes, mam...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
Can you swim?
Yes mam...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
I think so...
The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
September 4 -- how far away is that?
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
My father taught me...
Yes, ma'am...?
Sausage and hambones!
Act like one!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Will they give him a trial?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
There are more important matters right now...
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
The N word?
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Hey, Chef.
What?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
YOU BASTARD!!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
I'll just try the first one.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
I thought you had something planned.
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Don't believe the hype!!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
They're not going to make it!
It can't be.
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Very professional of you.
I did nothing to the monitors.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Thank you.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I know, I know.
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Will you shut up already?
That's right.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
I don't know.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Close every door behind you!
Simulated space walking.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Barnes?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
That is one of my priorities.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
That's affirmative.
What kind of man?
No. I'm from Akron.
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I am underground.
You're a scumbag.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What ever happened to just bowling?
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Whips...orange whips.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
He's my father.
Are you sure he's dead?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
I'm not here to bowl.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Get out of there!
I can't...
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
But she's --
Nobody move!
What was that?
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
High Voltage?
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Geologists?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Working on it now, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
In a minute, sir.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
She's not gonna know, sir.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
She's not gonna know.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
Internal power.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What could have done this?
Eggs.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
Manifested?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
How long does it last?
Your watch.
You tell me.
Are you manifesting them?
No, he can't.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
I promise --
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
I --
You'd have to ask them.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Is it coming from our own computer?
You sound defensive.
Look, would you --
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
It's like...
What is it, Harry?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
You didn't say that about the food?
But why would she -- ?
Wisconsin?
Her legs are in the way.
Well, press something!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
But it's impossible.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
He's a pussy.
I don't see anything.
Please, Ted.
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Why's that?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Four.  Four years --
I don't know.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Who's going to pay me then?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I know that.
You could put it that way.
How can you store an energy field within you?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
Why?
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I'd consider it an honor.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Death to all bugs !
He was our teacher... He was great.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sir, no, sir.
Ace of spades.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
You and me, huh ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Is it true ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
He's nothing like you.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Not a problem.
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
What is it, Rico ?
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Decker....!
No.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Our... 'insignificance'?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
What answers?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to.
Who?
You quit.
I quit the movie.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It was either that, or a sardine.
I understand...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That whole...
Surest thing you know.
Yes...
You'd know better'n me.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
<u>How</u>...?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Read the card.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure did.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
...what...?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
But it'll stop the movie.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
What is it, a surprise?
That's right...
What are they offering?
I have to tell you something...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Hi.
Wat...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
I will.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
That's right.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I don't eat vegetables.

You got to get out of here...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
You mind...?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Of course he...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
I, uh...  Um...
Well, what's the beef?
We know that you weren't.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Who is that...?
...we had a script conference...
Yeah.
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...wants a piece...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Main Street.
You were in the car with Bob?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
My wife's going to have a baby.
He should be put in jail.
You should.
I had a witness I would.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
He saw the accident...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I grew up on your mov...
Where have you been...?
I'm out.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I left that for you.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
Is that one hell of a kid?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...not the Lazyboy...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...not at all...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Yes, I hear it.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I killed her!
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Mass hysteria.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Sex.  Of course.
During sex.
...why do you think?
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
I'll be there for you.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
And...?
Actually.  I could only help him.
Good girl.
Hold lunch!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
That doesn't bother me.
But Rache...
Then have a donut --
Alright starve.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
I have lava.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
If you want me to hate her I will.
You have the WORST flu since...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Oh.
I helped.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Because you don't really seem here.
You're WHERE?
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
I was in there in him.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Fine, forget it.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You're not dying.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Jesus.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
I know that.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Don't ever say that.
What?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
You know...Stanley...
He was in a concentration camp?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
This is work.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
Jesus was not bad.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
I am sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready!
What?
Is everything OK?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
The same.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
OK!
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Maybe. She's OK.
Fuck me hard!
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
What's that supposed to mean?
Because I'll be firing at them.
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Good.
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
What!
Excellent...excellent!
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
So what?
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
No, sir.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Yes?
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
How long will it take to receive them all?
How many planes did we lose?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Hang on, boys.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
No kidding.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Everything still checks out okay.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What are you talking about?
You tell me.
I said that's the point!
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Can I have some?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
A cloud?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
I'd get bored.
That sounds so depressing.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Oh, So what about her?
No, no, whoa!
I could.
A reel?
No, not really. Middle-class.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Who were you talking to?
Nobody. Sooze.
Sooze wants to see him.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
No.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Yeah.
What feelings?
My goal is to make art.
Mm.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
I, yeah.
For a ride.
What?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Like songs?
Yeah.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I don't know.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey!
Oh, yeah?
It's pretty exciting.
Mine too.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
No, I'm going.
Whatever.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
The fuck not?
Conan went to Harvard.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Positive.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Spit from your dad?
He Ikea'd us.
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
You're kidding.
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Uh...maybe?
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Where's the bar?
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
You sure have.
Why should you do that?
We're engaged.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
What were you -- a child actress?
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
If you please.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
This is where you live?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
If you love me, Joe.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Get out.
Why?
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Of course it is.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.

You think this is all very funny.
A little.
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Great stars have great pride.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
That isn't true! Max?
Madame is waiting.
I'm not here.
Uh-huh?
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
That's right.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Haven't got a thing.
Paramount is calling.
But what will happen?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
You don't like me? You hate me?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
I don't see why not.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I did.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Oh, sure.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
I'd rather not talk about it.
She's a beast.
It was just a trim.
He's nice.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You're wasting your breath.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Criminals.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Why?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Mr. Roebush?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Too much mayonnaise?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me neither...
Uh-huh.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Say!
What are you doing?
Nope, but --
Yeah. A raise . .
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
KRYPTONITE!
They ain't got captains?
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
Anytime.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
What's wrong?
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Never closed my eyes.
You're not selfish at all.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Genius!  --  Lex.
Wrong.
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
Now This I want to hear.
No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
I asked the right question.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Where?
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
We will bring him to his knees!
Australia.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
He ran in fear from us . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
It will. Starting with your own.
Yes, but will you honor it?
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Go on . . .
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I am master now.
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Thank you.
I've been on the job.
Well!
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
What the  --  !
Oh, for God's sake!
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Oh.
First the pets, Otis.
I read the article.
I'm going to bed.
No, you're going to get kissed,
I know...
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Tea?
You can't do this to me!
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Right on the first guess.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Pink.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him this new face.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
Which one?
Which one?
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I understand.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why are you telling me this?
Why?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Billy, please.  The children.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
That's because he misses you.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
I better get back.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why?
Yes.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Did his parents attend to that?
You hate it.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
So he was mean?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Indian?
Almost three.
Thanks.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
No.
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
Does it fit?
Nothing.
Is "he" inside?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Is it news to you?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
No.  I'm going home.
Susan!...
Are you finished?
Get Steve back his job...please...
What does that mean - integrity?
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
What would you think of me if -
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
I know you do, Sidney.
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
See me in my office.
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No one must follow your work.
No way!
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
Can I stop by my house?
I would.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Smile?
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Drive faster.
Where you going?!
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
No!  Don't kill him!
Uh huh.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Some.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Then you're going to kill me.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
It's the truth.
Sure.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yes, you remember.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
He did?
Who's he?
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Absolutely not.
Wrong.
Alright, the beige one.
What's it to ya?
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Freezing.
You'll learn.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Hot dogs?
Someone?
Ticklish?
You're not supposed to.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I just called.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Then, you kiss his ass.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Why not?
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
They'll love that.
You're the one who started running.
I think not.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
You?
What's wrong?
Nicholas...
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
What are you doing?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
No!
Single?
Never better.
Really?
Trust me.  Call that number.
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Slow down, take a breath...
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
How do you know?
Did she?
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
I hope.
And if nothing's lacking?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Goodnight then.
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Did you worry about him?
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
What gentleman, Maria?
Why are you following me?
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Don't ask.
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
There's a carriage house around back.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
No.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
That's why we're here.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
You're okay.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I think so.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
Anything but Japanese.
We all did.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Come over here.
Our black friends?
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
Y'what?
This ain't your lot?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
What?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
First in, first out, that's me.
That would be too easy.
Again?
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
Weren't you on a television series?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Something like that, yeah.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Mr. Lindgren.
I see.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Who remembers.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
No kidding.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Hey.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
What d'you mean, any happier?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
There is?
What's in it?
How we gonna get that lucky?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Susan.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
And you should tell Doris...
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann--
Hello, Tony.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
Oh, Mr Crane--
Just see him, as a favor to me.
But more or less.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Did she make mistakes?
Uh--
No. I--tell me--
And how do we share--
Cash?!
Sure.
Look, uh... Creighton...
...You know... who *who* is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Big Dave--
I, uh...
Yeah, right.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...I don't think so.
No thanks.
So--
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
This hair.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Not an owner.
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
Behind you.
Hurry up!
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
What's left of it.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
All right everybody, hold up!
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
I don't understand.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
What happened?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
What was it?
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
One.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
All prop cars accounted for?
Amnesia.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
No.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
How about them?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
You blaming me for the traffic?
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Truman, stop it!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Is there any way around?
Were you there--how do you know?
We don't even know you.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
No. Don't bother.
Yeah, I did.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Something sweet.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
According to this tag.
What did you find?
How was it contracted?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
For the purpose of what?
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
She was with me.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
How deep does this go?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I want to know where Scully is.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'd be there for him.
No.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Baked in a pie.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Like hell "wait."
I can't leave him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Good for them.
It doesn't matter...
Awaiting his arrival.
Now.
Give her some cigarettes.
Were you at the inquest?
Silly looking bunch.
Where is she?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
I'm so sorry.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
There's nothing in them.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
You a friend of Lime's?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Ever seen one?
I'm not asking you to.
I see.
Which side of the road?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
Take him to Sacher's.
Do you know his number?
No, I don't know...
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
I told the police.
Why not?
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Must be some mistake.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Yes.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Richard. Hi.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Nice work.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
A fin!
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
No.
It's just the sky, Richard.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
I don't care about money.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
The sex is better.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
What were you, following me?
I thought you hated Torah.
I can't help what I think.
How did you...?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
I've got to get back to the --
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Get out of here....
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
Christ...
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Do I give a shit?
We think you'd be good at it.
And let us say...
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Enzo Molinari.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Italy!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Why?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
No...
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
People say that?
... Everything.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Thank you, thank you very much!
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
... I was right about what?
Tea... or whiskey?
We saw each other a little while ago.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Especially the sneakers.
My wallet.
I'd better get back now.
I did?
Why?
I'm still here.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
... Not at all.
You sure?
You'll understand.
... Nothing.
You want to lie down for a while?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Promise you won't forget me.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Then, goodbye.
What do you want me to do?
Please, call me Mordechai.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
C'mon follow me.
Sure. Why not.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
I forgive you.
We go to the same temple.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Mazel Tov!
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
I don't know —-
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
I sleep it off.
I don't know.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Sure.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Who?
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I'll miss you too, honey --
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
That's right, of course.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
Some crazy guy.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Thanks.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Go on foot.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I'm sure of it!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And did you find the leopard?
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
You a tourist?
That depends what you’re looking at.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Can it be that easy?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
There’s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Huh! Really? Hotels?
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Sorry?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
To get me killed...?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
You’re a long way from home...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What’s the Ambassador?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Well, I’m sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I’ve got the week off and he’s come to stay.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
What if it is?
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Any friends?
Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Shut up and drive!
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
‘Le Mercury’. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
Have you?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
I’ll be alone.
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
... No.
No...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Alors quoi?
Five seconds. Then you die.
Three...
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Of course I am, it's just that...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Come with me...
But it is what I want.
Do as I say!
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
One day you will.
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
And when was that?
We want her burned as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
God defeated the English, not me.
But where are you going to be?
Trial?  What trial??
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
In a village called Domremy.
Praying.
Silence her!  Take her away...!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Yes... they were.
He's on the other side of the river.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Jeanne... we're not enough...
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Because... because you just can't!
I said, kneel!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
So your memory's coming back?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, I...
I don't think so.
No...
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Dead.
How will we sleep?
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
What's happened?
A good place for what?  He's insane!
You're out, aren't you?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Pig!
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
I'm not going anywhere.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
I am... I was a pianist.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
... without a shred of manners.
Like it were a piano?
There is something to be said for silence
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
And where did they get married?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
I don't want to learn.
What are they?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Billie.  You ready?
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Don't worry about it, pal.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
I like griftin'.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
I'm busy, Floyd.
They workin' for anybody?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You never do, kid.
I'll take him anyway.
I thought I'd lost him.
Then why you doin' it?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
I also gotta win.
Five and call.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Get on with it then.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
How am I gonna do that?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
No.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
You weren't hired to miss him.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
You know how they are... sex...
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Why not?
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
There. 
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
You see how much we have to say.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Gilbert!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Keep on asking.
No.
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
What about Jorgensen?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He telephoned me today.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Don't you remember....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Yes?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Take it easy.
That's jolly.
At breakfast.
Breakfast.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You bet I wouldn't.
Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick!
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
You worked here?
No... no.
I know I left them there.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Home?
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
I heard!
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
There might be.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Invest it.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Just be cool.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
It's a fire fight.
It's giving.
You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
What if he's not?
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Damn.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
It's got to be going better than this..
Just let me rest for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
What?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Yeah, you're funny.
For real?  A treasure?
Naw, nothing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
What!?
What?
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Yeah, well, we're not.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like food.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
You don't know.  You don't....
Don't let them separate us.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
No!...No!...
What?
THX and me.
Incredible!
Not very encouraging.
What?
Right now.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
I don't care.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
You don't know that!
Look more closely.
I thought of something.....
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Where are they?
No thanks, Bev.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Now wait just a fucking-
Only once, at Redstone.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Right.
You don't have to talk about it.
Stay to your left.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
We work fast enough for you?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
He's my brother...
I know. I warned them.
Take him!
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Look who's talking, old man.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
It's about this.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Well, have you found it?
<u>Niente!</u>
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No.
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Smart. London, eh?
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Doc--!
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
Two weeks and three days.
No, not at all!
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
What is it?
Monescu.
Good day, Doctor.
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Disappointed?
No, thank you.
Monescu!
Certainly!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Lily-- 
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Naturally I did.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
The same thing.
You're hired!
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
Yes--uh--
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
To M'sieu Laval?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
We've struck ice.
No you won't.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
You're crazy.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Au contraire, mon cher.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
It's so cold.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I should like to see my drawing.
You had it the entire time?!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
I don't understand.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
No-o!
Guess again, copper.
We'll be expecting you.
I could stand some more--
At seven-thirty?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Sorry.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Sally--!
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
We'll let it go at that--
Lose?--I won a little--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
What is it?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll go with you--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Sure.
Send that.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
I can see you're no gentleman--
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Miss Marsh.
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Eh?... Oh.
I went for four.
--you'd go with him!
You can't bluff me any more.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Telegrams.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Excuse me?
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Better.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Sorry, sorry...
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Sorry...
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
What was that all about?
No.
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
How would you know?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
'Least they don't scare women.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Wyatt...
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I wonder if it runs in the family.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
Is this another one of your games?
Nothing.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
She married a hockey player.
That's reassuring.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I'll keep that in mind.
- You're not.
... We have time for that?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Next time, I do the driving.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
And when might that be?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Of course.
I understand.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
Who is it?
Yes.
Since when?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
They're too big.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
I'm going back home with Harry.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
It is just a regular card.
Not anymore, not in the city.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
You should go back and rest.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Tolerable well.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Only if you can spare it.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Those boys never did have good luck.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Okay...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Here!  In the car!
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Shhh!
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
What's with him?
I got dibs on his hat!
How 'bout three out of five?
I don't know!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
I thought he was at summer camp!
Uh-oh.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
I did like the music.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Let me in.
Victoria -
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
How much do I pay him?
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
What?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
No, not yet.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Helena --
Will we get invited to the White House?
Yes.
What's that mean?
What is this, like freebase?
Have you done your homework, honey?
Nope.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
That thought makes me feel awful.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
What?
No.
I'm aware of that.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Any way we can do it better?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
Yes, I hope so as well.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
I'm going home.
Where's that?
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Is that a promise, then?
Well, it isn't.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Sixteen next month.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Do you recall the school motto?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No.
Nightmare.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Lewis Gilbert.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Say something, Mark, say something --
Did he -- you know?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
You're all hear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
We're two thousand short.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
That's hardly a substitute.
Are you serious?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
A walk.
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
A Federation starship.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
It's all I have.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I don't understand.
Are we leaving, Captain?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Let me do something.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
A "t."
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
Fire the rockets!
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
No. I refuse.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
Am I? We'll see.
No special conditions?
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Hi, Flynn.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Okay, okay...
I mean I want both of us to go.
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
Hello, Alan.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Cute.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Then...
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
Recognizers!
Little more juice's all it needs...
We have to talk.
But-what if I can't...?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
Do it!
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Where are you going?
I have a book report.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yes.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
She's having an affair.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Here they come.
Yes sir.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Me too.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Yes.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Get going! 
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You'll call me then?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
What letter?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
You can't have just one.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Where are you from.
Yes, I would.
What kinda music do you like?
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
What would make you think that?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Take that shit somewhere else.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
She's with me.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You goin' out?
It'll get ya high.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
What are we gonna see?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Want an animal cracker?
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
He trusts you?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
They'll be along.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Who is he?
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Could we try it now?
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Pussy love pink rocks.
What can I do?
No way, JosÈ.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Yes.
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, what?
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
What?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
No more drugs.  Please...
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
James, why don't we...?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
Shot!  Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I don't know -- I don't remember.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I...I...We need cash, James.
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Christ no!
That a fact?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
That's my morning's pay.
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
But, in particular?
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
He's up at the Look Out.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What?
Please, just leave the car alone.
You got the money?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Who the hell is this!?
Wrong number.
Do you have to call me that?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
You should be more careful.
That's all right.  I got it.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Those are white words, not ours.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
You know what I want.
You love him?
You could just leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Yeah.
Where?
Jake.
John, please--
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What was I supposed to do?
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
Not me.  Us.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
But I want to say with you,
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
Grace!
What for?
Someone will find me.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Like you don't know.
Just ran into a little trouble.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Make it twenty.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Is the job done?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
You think that's a lot of money?
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's a thick change of heart.
I said come on!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You're too quick for me.
For what?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Senor, you need a doctor.
No police!
Christ no!
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
All right, old man.  Christ.
Christ!
Hell no!
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What's your name anyway?
Harlin around?
How much time?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
May I carry your package, Grace?
What happened to your hand?
That's all right.  I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
You love him?
You could leave him.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
You don't have any money put away, do you?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I don't know about that?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
Can you make it back up?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Where to?
The ticket is 30.55.
Genuine Draft?
What was that all about?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
I said come on!
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
out again?
Jesus.
Seventy-five percent.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
No.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Fine.
Was your family traveling with you?
Did you get up from your seat?
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
Nope.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
What?
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
A sign on him?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Yeah.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
We all got it comin', Kid.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
You ain't shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Eleven.
This Kid, what's he like?
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Did I what?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Plenty of times.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
That ain't what I mean.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
There's more.
Just forget about it.
I love you.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Did you hear what he just said?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
I'11 be alright.
No killing?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What if I
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What about Redfoot?
You're lying.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
What?
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
He loved her.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
Then why didn't you help him?
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.  It would be.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
Yes!
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
It's a crime.
I...yes.
You've just said you signed it.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
) I'm sorry ...?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Then why don't you testify?
I was held up.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Kathy Price.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
What is that to you...?
No.
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
They still have to take it to a jury.
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah.
I don't know.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I'm sure you do ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
I just saw her.
Mrs...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
But you knew about this.
Nothing.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
What happened?
Why?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning.
Why?!
Yes --
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Why?
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
No... it's wrong.
Shopping?
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
I don't like them.
No.
Madeleine!
Here with you.
Yes...
Long ago...
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
What do you remember?
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It wasn't your fault.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Ah, Johnny-O...
I've never run across one like that.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Normal.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Could be.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
And she died...
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
What?
I said how's it going?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
It's sacrilegious.
Eat my ass!
You're a loser.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Just giving the facts.
Have you ever done this before?
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
That is absolutely not true.
I am not flexible on this.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Don't talk to me about character.
They won't figure it out.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
I know and I'm honored...
It has to be done.
I got you.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Sweet deal.
Left side.
Here's his head.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Boyd...What have we done?
Suck my ass.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What does that mean?
Take Mexico.
They need leadership.
Ball park sausages.
Goosed!
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Are we going to do this again?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You expect more what?
With all my heart.
Okay.
You go down there.
Well you should.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Yeah. You.
No.
The prostitute.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Come on.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
Yup.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Was that difficult to get?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Evil.
Thank you, Uncle.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
You must listen to me before you go.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
No.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
All right, Mother.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Good, then let's go!
Yes, yes, I saw you!
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Why wasn't I told?
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Not from in here.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I'M WHAT?!
He hears...everything.
What's wrong with Parker?
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Of course you are.
A little less than yesterday.
I know who would know.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Enjoying yourself?
This isn't a game, Parker!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
...I think so...You?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
I don't think you're gonna need it.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
What'd ya think?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
And you?
What's it gonna cost? 
...the... 
The American "people"?
<u>Who</u>?
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
...this's <u>good</u>...
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
...what are we going to do...?
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
I have a question for you.
...you the Press Office?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Is that true?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
I never won an Oscar.
They got to have something that we want.
Why would they want that?
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Where is he now?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Uh...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
A proud tradition.
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
...what is this?
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Better.
Yes.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
The hats.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
What'd you tell him?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
You're learning, sport...
How much?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
Only if I want something bad enough.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Get the hell out!
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Jenkins!
Good evening sir.
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
They seemed, closing by much 
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Big deal!
Who's is all this?
China
Sell my soul?
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Then why did you?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Have you been hurt?
That can't feel good.
Is everything alright?
And then you weren't there.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Jody, no...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
This.
What?
Then what was it?
Did I?
But Claire--
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
I can't believe this is happening.
Like what?
Did he say that?
I guess not.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
More or less.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
What kind of whispering?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You know what that does to me.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Oh, no...
"...for my father."
A flare?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Tonight?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We had a seance.
Who did?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
We walked all night...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
In the living room...
Not personally.
Yes.  The ghost.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Oh God...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
I never asked you to quit!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
To Caitlin!!
How can you be sure?
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Nothing.
Shhhh.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
But you've not told Michael.
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
I want to see my mother.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Then you wear it.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
The door, Michael.  find the key...
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
It's too soon to know.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Leave me alone!
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Yessss...
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
A little wine...?
That's cause we're below sea level.
That's not funny.
- we made a fire.
Go ahead.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Stop it!
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
If you like that type.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I like him.  He can stay.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes - I have had it for years.
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Then make it stop...
Open it...
No thanks - 
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
No - a dentist
Don't worry about it -
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
The lesson being?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Everything.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
It's not up to me.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
He didn't. He had it built.
And then what?
Let's do it.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I see.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Oh. Goodness.
Forget the store. Think big.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
He was in a league of his own.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Back to the land of grownups.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
Yeah.
Yes.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
And what do they say?
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I said he did.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Yeah, but...
What brain?
Nothing.
Shit.
I miss Dad.
Where, the mall?
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
That's not your line.
You think that's wise?
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
There's nothing for them to get.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Starting with a screw?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Yes.  Now, observe....
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
It's a repeating steam cannon!
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
What way is that?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
It's not a guy...
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Private train?
My friend?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Nicely said, sir.
And now the job's yours.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
I don't believe you.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Absolutely!
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Then I will teach you.
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
There's nobody here.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Why?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Why not?
I've seen pictures.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Move! Or you die right here!
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
How long?
What?
How long have I been here?
I know what he said.
Oh. The bullets.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I know.
It won't happen again.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I don't know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
No...
Looks dead...
They are English. They don't understand.
Yes.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Oh ....
Not so fast!  Not....
Ohhh!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Toto, too.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
How did you guess?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, you....
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh-oh-
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Hah!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Oh, come on.
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh --
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
I -- Oh --
Yes, you.
That's right.
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Help!
I was hoping you could tell me.
Made to look just like an accident.
But what if...
Renard.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Yes.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
I think you do.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Where did you get this?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Is it?
How would you know?
Why?  What's the problem?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Collect me?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Laurie --
Okay!
The costumes.  Am I right?
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
-- What?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
You're making a big --
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Who says you're the good guys?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
He gets to be the hero.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Yorgi asked me to.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
I'm through, Xander.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Beast.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Uh-huh.
Not interested.
He takes his work seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Senator?
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What do you want?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Enough for a test.
And who might you be?
Now wait a minute!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Yes, sir.
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
You're incorrigible!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
I suppose you're right.
I suppose you're right.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Fron kon steen!
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
How?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Not fooling around.
Why don't we talk inside?
His schwanzstucker.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
